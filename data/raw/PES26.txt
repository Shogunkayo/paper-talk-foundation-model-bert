19/08/2022, 8:37 pm - +91 79750 80168: The degree is called btech in cse with spec in aiml and not btech in aiml so that problem is gone
19/08/2022, 8:37 pm - +91 79750 80168: Me
19/08/2022, 8:42 pm - +91 90363 04965: Its the same thing?
19/08/2022, 8:47 pm - +91 95084 21687: No it isn't
19/08/2022, 9:26 pm - +91 73489 60999: If you take just cse you can specialise in ai/ml or other things as well. But with ai/ml it's like the specialisation is compulsory
19/08/2022, 9:26 pm - +91 73489 60999: That COI himself told both have 80-90% same syllabus.
19/08/2022, 9:26 pm - +91 73489 60999: *COO
19/08/2022, 9:27 pm - +91 90363 04965: ohh
19/08/2022, 9:59 pm - +91 88846 19998: I'd argue there's a difference between the words specialise and minor in but it's basically correct
19/08/2022, 10:00 pm - +91 88846 19998: It's like how you can become a doctor with an mbbs but a specialisation in say radiology requires specific courses in your masters
19/08/2022, 10:01 pm - +91 88846 19998: Doing AI/ML will help you start and go down that route but it won't necessarily give you an edge or a disadvantage
19/08/2022, 10:01 pm - +91 99456 67559: bois let's enter college first :)

20/08/2022, 1:14 pm - +91 95084 21687: Network sucks from there.I tried booking an uber but failed
20/08/2022, 1:14 pm - +91 90363 04965: No European commode? 🥲
20/08/2022, 1:15 pm - +91 95084 21687: Had to leave the campus for that

20/08/2022, 1:36 pm - +91 87703 44403: okay
20/08/2022, 1:36 pm - +91 88846 19998: Gives you more area to look around atleast
20/08/2022, 1:36 pm - +91 87703 44403: okk

20/08/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 88846 19998: 35 or something no
20/08/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 88846 19998: For buses a year
20/08/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 99028 64009: 40 i think
20/08/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 91484 28786: 40
20/08/2022, 1:39 pm - +91 88846 19998: I'd argue bmtc is much for uncomfortable if you're going to be there for more than 5 stops
20/08/2022, 1:39 pm - +91 88846 19998: Replace for with more*
20/08/2022, 1:39 pm - +91 88846 19998: Yikes...

20/08/2022, 1:41 pm - +91 99028 64009: That's 8 and above in morning
20/08/2022, 1:41 pm - +91 93980 24181: I sent them transaction details through mail

20/08/2022, 3:27 pm - +91 96730 74688: One thing I know before even entering college is never trust the management man
20/08/2022, 3:28 pm - +91 99028 64009: Yes😂
20/08/2022, 3:29 pm - +91 99028 64009: The golden Jubilee at this rate will get over proly when we finish 4th year ig
20/08/2022, 3:35 pm - +91 95386 34638: Exactly 😭😭
20/08/2022, 3:56 pm - +91 80884 07523: By the time they finish the golden jubilee building it'll be time to start constructing the platinum jubilee one

22/08/2022, 11:02 am - Aditeya Baral: If you intend to make notes, just the general stuff. Remember to buy a scientific calculator
22/08/2022, 11:04 am - +91 99865 58635: Guys does anyone have document verification now cet
22/08/2022, 11:13 am - +91 95084 21687: If notebooks then how many should work?
22/08/2022, 11:13 am - Aditeya Baral: Depends on how much you intend to write no

22/08/2022, 11:14 am - +91 95084 21687: I thought subject wise
22/08/2022, 11:14 am - Aditeya Baral: I used to use those classmate thin notebooks
22/08/2022, 11:20 am - +91 96730 74688: What I read somewhere was , students buy those spiral notebooks and a few paper clips 

The spiral notebook is for all subjects so you just carry one notebook throughout the day and then at the end of the day he segregated them subject wise using paper clips 


Kind of makes it complicated tho
~idts it's worth it but do try lol
22/08/2022, 11:23 am - Aditeya Baral: Yeah but since you're covering 6 subjects in one book they tend to get over faster, plus need to carry stuff for all subjects everyday. 

It's a personal choice, do whatever works best for you
22/08/2022, 11:23 am - Aditeya Baral: Main thing is the calculator. You'll be using it in most of your first year courses from math to chem as well
22/08/2022, 11:24 am - Aditeya Baral: Remember to buy it and also spend time getting used to it
22/08/2022, 11:24 am - Aditeya Baral: Also, PES doesn't let you carry the calculator cover (which sometimes has instructions and other helpful hints on how to use the calculator). A lot of people struggle to use the calculator in the exams since they never used it before
22/08/2022, 11:25 am - Aditeya Baral: So you need to also know _how_ to use the calculator. For some reason a lot of people ignore this 😂
22/08/2022, 11:26 am - +91 79750 80168: How do I get used to it an engineering graduate gave his old scientific calculator to me but it seems so complex.🤣
22/08/2022, 11:28 am - +91 96730 74688: We need a seminar from seniors lmao , where the explain how to work around rules and management
22/08/2022, 11:28 am - +91 96730 74688: They*
22/08/2022, 11:28 am - +91 79750 80168: True, especially management 💀
22/08/2022, 11:39 am - Aditeya Baral: All calculators will have some simple manuals online, check them out
22/08/2022, 11:44 am - +91 74838 53923: The same calculator we used for isc no?
22/08/2022, 11:44 am - +91 96730 74688: Any update on KCET drama?
22/08/2022, 11:45 am - +91 99456 67559: Upto sep 9 doc verification I heard
22/08/2022, 11:45 am - +91 99456 67559: 2nd round pessat and 1st round kcet will be around sep end
22/08/2022, 11:45 am - +91 96730 74688: Court case cleared ?
22/08/2022, 11:46 am - +91 99456 67559: No idea should look into it
22/08/2022, 11:47 am - +91 96730 74688: Do students who take admission thorough KCET will have to go through the state counseling or PES holds their own
22/08/2022, 11:48 am - +91 99456 67559: State
22/08/2022, 11:52 am - +91 78922 40050: But doesn't pes start on sept 5?
22/08/2022, 11:54 am - +91 89054 72730: For the pessat quota students
22/08/2022, 11:54 am - +91 89054 72730: For kcet and 2nd round pessat students they’ll start another batch I think
22/08/2022, 11:55 am - +91 96730 74688: 2nd round PESSAT students are those only na who did not get desired branch in Round 1 
So new new students that's why they will start for all PESSAT students and later branch change
22/08/2022, 11:55 am - +91 96730 74688: No new*
22/08/2022, 12:22 pm - +91 89054 72730: Hey can the 1st round pessat students also join late?😅

23/08/2022, 8:54 am - Aditeya Baral: Your PRN is a universal roll number, so it's across departments and branches. Your SRN is branchwise and gives you your roll number in your branch

He went on a walk with his fellow Pikachu, the park was close to his house. While he was walking he meet qiqi, she was singing her famous “ Everybody who loses 50/50 … doesn’t like me to pop on their screens” sadly. Spongebob looked at the interesting young girl and walked away expecting to be stabbed in the back. The next person who he came across was Goku trying to fight a local Chihuahua… it was honesty the weirdest moment cause for some reason the Chihuahua was winning

06/09/2022, 7:37 pm - +91 96061 40554: Say for example you choose kabaddi and get selected. Then to practice kabaddi in the cricket ground do we have to pay 10k or what
06/09/2022, 7:38 pm - +91 96061 40554: Because if we get selected, ideally shouldn't we be allowed to train for free?
06/09/2022, 7:38 pm - +91 99014 37680: Boss

08/09/2022, 5:22 am - +91 90192 63571: Guys, there's a small issue. The WhatsApp group is full and many people can't join. So would it be possible to convert this into a BTech only group ? 
Otherwise we can't accommodate everyone...

08/09/2022, 4:14 pm - +91 90192 63571: Guys, could the non BTech kids create a separate group and _shift_ there ?
You could send the link on this group tho.... and then shift.
08/09/2022, 4:14 pm - +91 90192 63571: The whole BTech strength is huge so after a point of time we'll have to switch to some other platform and probably by then we may be more active in the respective class groups...
08/09/2022, 4:14 pm - +91 90192 63571: So can any BDes/BBA/Bcom take up the initiative to create a new group ??
08/09/2022, 4:14 pm - +91 83102 01301: Ay this topic got over no

08/09/2022, 6:50 pm - +91 88846 11078: i'm guessing it's there for now
08/09/2022, 6:51 pm - Aditeya Baral: I think if they demolished G block we seniors would have heard about it by now xD
08/09/2022, 6:52 pm - +91 83102 01301: Yea that's what
08/09/2022, 6:52 pm - +91 88846 19998: G block is the block next to the drain no?
08/09/2022, 6:52 pm - +91 99014 37680: yea that one

08/09/2022, 6:53 pm - +91 88846 19998: G block is the actual catfish block
08/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 79756 56645: But everyone got their sections which start with f
08/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 88846 19998: Full golden jubilee and BE block they showed to lure us in
08/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 88846 19998: And put us in f block
08/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 88846 19998: Scam
08/09/2022, 6:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah that's usually what happens here
08/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 99014 37680: pes is scam dw
08/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 88846 19998: 😔
08/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 88846 19998: I hope i don't get g block ever
08/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 88846 19998: Is there any way to get past that 85% attendance
08/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 88846 19998: Some colleges let you do whatever if you have 9 no
08/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 88846 19998: Like that
08/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 88846 19998: 9 cgpa*

08/09/2022, 6:58 pm - +91 99014 37680: 😂😂😂😂😂
08/09/2022, 6:58 pm - +91 88846 19998: So many kids get kicked out everyday...i see them in lifts and all
08/09/2022, 6:58 pm - +91 88846 19998: Do they lose attendance??
08/09/2022, 6:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: Usually clubs used to be a good way to scam attendance. But in recent times it's become more difficult
08/09/2022, 6:58 pm - +91 88846 19998: 😭
08/09/2022, 6:58 pm - +91 88846 19998: Hmm...
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 82966 96682: die in PIL
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 82966 96682: if you can get in

08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 77188 25988: Oof
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: 85% is a soft margin. Hard margin is 75. Anything below that and they'll call you for extra make up classes
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 88846 19998: Innovation Lab?
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 99014 37680: for us some teachers are there who mark us absent even though we are there for the entire hour 🥲
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 88846 19998: Someone told me you'll lose cgpa
08/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 88846 19998: Bruh 💀
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Nah
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 88846 19998: What do you do then??
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 99014 37680: not anymore
they've made 80 hard margin
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Really eh
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 88846 19998: Ask for cctv thing uh
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Lmao F
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 99014 37680: yea
it's too hard now
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Guys keep it above 80
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: You don't want to be called to college for extra classes just for attendance the week before your ESAs
08/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 99014 37680: near sem exams they'll send one spreadsheet of all people who have less than required
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 99014 37680: there are no extra classes
they just don't write esa
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: For public viewing also so everyone in the batch can nicely see
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 99014 37680: they don't get hall ticket or something
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 88846 19998: So they lose half their grade uh 💀
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 82966 96682: omg slayyyy
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: Nah, if it's within an acceptable range - that is if you attend the extra classes and if it crosses the threshold then they'll tell you to come
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 82966 96682: just as a girlboss would
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 80884 07523: Public interest litigation
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 79756 56645: 😂
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 79756 56645: It's pes innovation lab
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 79756 56645: PIL
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 80884 07523: No
08/09/2022, 7:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: So for example if your attendance is 78-79 and if they see if you attending those extra classes will make it cross 80, then they'll call you
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: we usually just beg the teachers
and they give off depending on how good you are in class
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Atleast it used to be this way
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Now could be different
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 88846 19998: You get stuff for 100% attendance in college uh??
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: i've never heard of extra classes and half my friends had 75% attendance
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: balls
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 79756 56645: Lol no idts
08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 79756 56645: It's not school

08/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 80884 07523: 🏳️‍🌈
08/09/2022, 7:03 pm - +91 88846 19998: I haven't had more than 60% attendance in like 5 years 💀
08/09/2022, 7:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Nah
08/09/2022, 7:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: So the strategy I had was, I never bunked and saved up all that attendance. If you don't miss a single class right until the end, you get to take close to 2-2.5 weeks off
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 79756 56645: Who is bread? 😂
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Add an extra week to that (the week before ESA is always off)
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 79756 56645: Woah
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 80884 07523: Genius
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: And you're effectively looking at a 3 week off
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Right before exams
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ofc you'll have to come for lab exams
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Which are scheduled in those weeks
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: our sems are too short, so max one week we can skip
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: but yes
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 88846 19998: I'm tempted... because I really don't wanna go do class after ISA's
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: that's what we do
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: But it's not too much of an issue
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 84315 99055: Guys just wanted to confirm that tom is a holiday and compensation workshop is on sat right ?
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 88846 19998: Or maybe get an extra week before esa's
08/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 88846 19998: Indeed
08/09/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 88846 19998: Bread is bread
08/09/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 82395 18499: Great bro, please add this in description
08/09/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 84315 99055: Thanks
08/09/2022, 7:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Aren't they normal length now? Aug-Dec and Jan-May?
08/09/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 97406 94534: Bootstrap week isnt considered for attendance right
08/09/2022, 7:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Nope
08/09/2022, 7:06 pm - +91 79756 56645: U didn't attend??
08/09/2022, 7:06 pm - +91 99014 37680: december exams are there

08/09/2022, 7:06 pm - +91 91087 92419: Joining clubs was what our seniors were telling
Ull get forms that let u have absences from classes, no one cares beyond that
08/09/2022, 7:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: No there's is a catch
08/09/2022, 7:07 pm - +91 91087 92419: Fr?
08/09/2022, 7:07 pm - +91 79756 56645: When will we have the club activities? Like is there some specific day that we will have or what?
08/09/2022, 7:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: So they'll give you attendance as long as your attendance is below the cutoff. If it's above cutoff they won't give you that attendance
08/09/2022, 7:07 pm - +91 91087 92419: After hours
08/09/2022, 7:07 pm - +91 82395 18499: Are there any club, which we can join now

08/09/2022, 7:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also most clubs now function after hours, they don't let you organise during hours so no question of attendance
08/09/2022, 7:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Trust me scamming attendance is very difficult here
08/09/2022, 7:08 pm - +91 91087 92419: Sports selections r next week, I think forms for others will also be starting up from next week
08/09/2022, 7:08 pm - +91 91087 92419: Damn wow

10/09/2022, 3:10 am - +91 73490 23978: It might be the time we do our assignments in class
10/09/2022, 6:27 am - +91 82966 96682: any idea what textbooks we'll have to get?
10/09/2022, 7:01 am - +91 80884 07523: Someone said textbooks aren't necessary at all, class slides and notes are sufficient and teachers tell you what reference books you can use, most of which are in the library
10/09/2022, 7:04 am - +91 98867 39499: Also having them in pdf form is better they said, since most only last a sem or 2.
10/09/2022, 7:05 am - +91 79756 56645: And books are expensive itseems
10/09/2022, 7:10 am - +91 78993 01497: Yea, most of them buy so many textbooks and end up reading just a few pages from it because the entire textbook is not even needed
10/09/2022, 7:17 am - +91 97117 47696: So basically just like jee reference books...avoid buying them😅
10/09/2022, 7:20 am - +91 94447 88462: Borrow from seniors
10/09/2022, 7:20 am - +91 94447 88462: Ezzz
10/09/2022, 7:20 am - +91 82966 96682: lol thanks
10/09/2022, 7:20 am - +91 94447 88462: Anyways u won't buy books from 2nd year
10/09/2022, 7:20 am - +91 94447 88462: First years the only year u might need books
10/09/2022, 7:22 am - +91 79750 80168: Don't remind me about the thousands of rupees I wasted😢

10/09/2022, 4:25 pm - +91 6360 487 690: I thought it was till 3.30
10/09/2022, 4:25 pm - +91 99028 64009: It is but only 2 days this week
10/09/2022, 4:26 pm - +91 6360 487 690: Ok
10/09/2022, 4:46 pm - +91 82966 96682: yes
10/09/2022, 4:48 pm - +91 96064 30120: Which all days do we have class till 12:45 this week?
10/09/2022, 4:48 pm - +91 99028 64009: You need to see your timetable
10/09/2022, 4:48 pm - +91 88846 19998: I think it's class specific
10/09/2022, 4:48 pm - +91 99028 64009: Different for different sections
10/09/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 88846 19998: Monday and Thursday i have full day (A section)
10/09/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 96064 30120: But why do we have it like that?
10/09/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 99028 64009: Ask pes
10/09/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 88846 19998: Lmao
10/09/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 96064 30120: Lol ok thanks
10/09/2022, 4:50 pm - +91 88846 19998: I think it'll be like this for all weeks actually
10/09/2022, 4:51 pm - +91 88846 19998: Because usually the number of credits=number of hours of class per week
10/09/2022, 4:51 pm - +91 88846 19998: So EPD is worth four credits so you'll have hours of EPD per week
10/09/2022, 4:58 pm - +91 80734 96504: not only this week
10/09/2022, 4:59 pm - +91 81608 33258: For every week or this week??
10/09/2022, 5:00 pm - +91 99028 64009: We'll come to know every week anyways
10/09/2022, 5:00 pm - +91 99028 64009: When they give he timetable
10/09/2022, 5:00 pm - +91 99028 64009: Us*
10/09/2022, 5:00 pm - +91 81608 33258: Ok
10/09/2022, 5:01 pm - +91 80734 96504: i heard its until kcet ppl come
10/09/2022, 5:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: That's usually not the case
My five credit courses have 7 classes a week
10/09/2022, 5:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: This is why
They wanna slowly push you guys and cover up time later with cet peoplw
10/09/2022, 5:17 pm - +91 82966 96682: the timetable may change but number of hours should be same
10/09/2022, 5:18 pm - +91 88846 19998: O.o
10/09/2022, 5:18 pm - +91 88846 19998: Are they computer classes that are integrated with lab by any chance?
10/09/2022, 5:18 pm - +91 99014 37680: Yea that's why
10/09/2022, 5:19 pm - +91 88846 19998: Makes sense
10/09/2022, 5:19 pm - +91 88846 19998: Will our first isa be after cet people join or??
10/09/2022, 5:21 pm - +91 99014 37680: Nope
10/09/2022, 5:21 pm - +91 99014 37680: You'll write ISAs before they write
10/09/2022, 5:21 pm - +91 88846 19998: So it'll be three weeks from now???💀
10/09/2022, 5:21 pm - +91 99014 37680: But you'll write ESAs together
10/09/2022, 5:21 pm - +91 99014 37680: Probably
10/09/2022, 5:21 pm - +91 88846 19998: Interesting...
10/09/2022, 5:22 pm - +91 88846 19998: But how is that possible
10/09/2022, 5:22 pm - +91 88846 19998: If they start 4 weeks after us
10/09/2022, 5:22 pm - +91 88846 19998: How will they jam the time in
10/09/2022, 5:22 pm - +91 88846 19998: Will they be writing ISA's more often??
10/09/2022, 5:23 pm - +91 91484 28786: This message was deleted
10/09/2022, 5:26 pm - +91 82966 96682: probably
10/09/2022, 5:26 pm - +91 82966 96682: cause the second sem onwards should be the same for all of us
10/09/2022, 5:27 pm - +91 80734 96504: sexond year onwards ig its common
10/09/2022, 5:31 pm - +91 82965 44577: Right so so quick question is anyone brining anything apart from one book and a pen on Monday?
10/09/2022, 5:31 pm - +91 70190 44669: Nope
10/09/2022, 5:32 pm - +91 99028 64009: Nah
10/09/2022, 5:32 pm - +91 82965 44577: Okay 👍
10/09/2022, 5:54 pm - +91 88846 19998: Nyet
10/09/2022, 6:40 pm - +91 99014 37680: Better to get multiple
If you guys have bad luck, you'll have teachers checking notes and all
10/09/2022, 6:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: When did this start at PES now
10/09/2022, 6:43 pm - +91 96112 55845: Back to school eh? 😂☠️
10/09/2022, 6:43 pm - +91 99014 37680: It's trashy
Our math teacher in sem 1 checked everyone's notes and made students explain Linear Differential Equations
10/09/2022, 6:44 pm - Aditeya Baral: Jesus
10/09/2022, 6:44 pm - Aditeya Baral: This place really has gone to shit
10/09/2022, 6:44 pm - +91 96112 55845: I skipped that chapter 😭☠️
10/09/2022, 6:44 pm - +91 6362 844 543: ...
10/09/2022, 6:44 pm - Aditeya Baral: My batch was the last normal batch lolz
10/09/2022, 6:45 pm - +91 99014 37680: It has
10/09/2022, 6:45 pm - +91 89054 72730: Can we bring 6 subject in one register type?
10/09/2022, 6:46 pm - +91 99014 37680: I don't think so
10/09/2022, 6:46 pm - +91 99014 37680: One guy got belted for that
10/09/2022, 6:46 pm - +91 96320 07839: Ayo!?
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 99014 37680: Don't ask me
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 96320 07839: Beltin anol!?
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 99014 37680: If teachers started beating for homework then it would've been Narayana for sure
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 99014 37680: I meant scolded
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 99014 37680: Berated
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 79750 80168: Bro this college is literally a jee coaching for placements💀
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - +91 99014 37680: Whatever
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: Bro we all used to use those notebooks
10/09/2022, 6:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: What is happening to PESU
10/09/2022, 6:48 pm - +91 99014 37680: Going to shit by the looks of it
10/09/2022, 6:48 pm - +91 96320 07839: <Media omitted>
10/09/2022, 6:48 pm - +91 79750 80168: I already paid 4.2 laks🥲
10/09/2022, 6:48 pm - Aditeya Baral: Well in a lot of ways it is. A lot of people join here for the placements without caring about the field they are getting into
10/09/2022, 6:48 pm - +91 82966 96682: true
10/09/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 82966 96682: <Media omitted>
10/09/2022, 6:51 pm - Aditeya Baral: Throughout JEE prep your heads are drilled with the idea that better colleges = better packages without any information about the different fields out there and what your interest actually is, that is why you see colleges also advertising mainly using placement stats because that is what people in our country see
10/09/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 82966 96682: fr
10/09/2022, 6:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: And PESU is really good at marketing. They are everywhere in Bangalore - airports, parks, even on dustbins in Lalbagh and other places. If you stay in Bangalore you really can't miss it
10/09/2022, 6:52 pm - +91 81056 35154: This is true for any engineering college in india
10/09/2022, 6:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: And ofc they will flex their 1.5cr placement and other records. All parents and kids see are bigger packages after 4 years, you only get to know about it after joining. A lot of kids also realise their chosen branch isn't what they want to do halfway into engineering
10/09/2022, 6:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah unfortunately
10/09/2022, 6:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: There is a huge missing step in our education system between graduating 12th and stepping into college where people actually understand what all is there to explore and which fields to get into. That is why more people apply for better colleges/brand over what they want to do/passion
10/09/2022, 6:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: << Anyway that is my rant thanks for listening >>
10/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 82966 96682: agreed honestly
10/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 99014 37680: Bro i don't need psychological warfare on me now
10/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 81056 35154: Ur in second year ?
10/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 99014 37680: Yes
10/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 82966 96682: don't forget all the cse hype that contributes to that
10/09/2022, 6:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yes because in all colleges, CSE has best placements. And now everyone is riding the ML train because it is in demand
10/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 82966 96682: will be another branch in the future probably that gains as much traction as cse in a few years
10/09/2022, 6:57 pm - +91 81056 35154: Lmao btech in ai/ml is nothing but cs only
10/09/2022, 6:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: I remember when I used to hold ML sessions for my club 2-3 years ago, my first session was always an introductory session where instead of actually teaching ML I would tell people about what is actually there in this field
10/09/2022, 6:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: True that half of your courses will be the same, but you are being restricted in choice in terms of electives
10/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 82966 96682: oof you're also senior
10/09/2022, 6:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: There are a lot of people in PES currently interested in AIML, but there are also a lot of people interested in different fields. People shouldnt be restricted
10/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 81056 35154: Lmao never happened in the narayana i was in
10/09/2022, 6:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Bro my convocation was yesterday I got my degree also xD
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 96320 07839: Udk bout sir baral
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 99014 37680: Lucky 🥲
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 82966 96682: idk about anyone bro🤣
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 82966 96682: congratulations!
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 96320 07839: Sir baral is giga of gigas🙇🏻🙇🏻
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 81056 35154: Nor did they check any notebook nor did they care about one lmfao
10/09/2022, 7:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Lol issokay, people hype me more than deserved
10/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 96320 07839: Ayy no bro
10/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 82966 96682: how many seniors are there in this group actually
10/09/2022, 7:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: I mean if you put a public group link out there people are bound to join. Most of them lurk though. I sometimes text at the end of my work days lmao
10/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 80884 07523: You deserve the hype sir, great stuff on the discord
10/09/2022, 7:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Thanks lol
10/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 99456 67559: +1
10/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 96320 07839: ++
10/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 99456 67559: rowlet saar giving out of box gyaan 🙏
10/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 82966 96682: fair enough
10/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 82966 96682: oh this is rowlet??💀
10/09/2022, 7:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Hello sir
10/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 82966 96682: anw thanks for the advice 🙏🙏
10/09/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 82966 96682: all this hype around placements is making me feel fomo already bc i know i'll have to go to study masters instead 💀
10/09/2022, 7:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Eh don't let something 3 years in the future worry you now
10/09/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 80884 07523: Grind hard, steal others' placements and then do masters ez
10/09/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 81056 35154: Everyone wants placements only and don't really care abt the branch
10/09/2022, 7:06 pm - +91 82966 96682: fair enough i know in the end it's all up to our individual choices but i still can't help feel like that sometimes XD
10/09/2022, 7:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: It comes back to bite them down the line
10/09/2022, 7:06 pm - +91 82966 96682: how so?
10/09/2022, 7:07 pm - +91 82966 96682: genuine question
10/09/2022, 7:07 pm - +91 80884 07523: Probably why we have so many budding stand up comedians
10/09/2022, 7:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: People realise their interests later right. In face a few people in your batch might not even want to do engineering and are being forced due to various factors
10/09/2022, 7:08 pm - +91 82966 96682: ahh yeah in that sense
10/09/2022, 7:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or people might want to do engineering but due to lack of exposure to different fields they choose one to go ahead with and then later realise it's not for them. A lot of people in CS don't actually like CS once they realise it's not what it seems
10/09/2022, 7:08 pm - +91 81056 35154: Lmao people before joining college think CTC and base salary are the same thing , anyone can know what they are doing
10/09/2022, 7:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ah yeah. Companies use it to poach students too
10/09/2022, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: They'll offer you something like 60+ LPA packages but your base will be like 20, remaining paid after a yearly time period
10/09/2022, 7:11 pm - +91 81056 35154: That's what big companies do give 42 lakhs CTC with 18 base and when an engineer grad realises it , they be crying lmao
10/09/2022, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's what Apple did for my batch, Palo Alto did for 2023 batch
10/09/2022, 7:11 pm - +91 82966 96682: wow bait moment
10/09/2022, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Apple offered my batch 65, but with a base around 20
10/09/2022, 7:11 pm - +91 81056 35154: Ik 65 CTC and 22 base
10/09/2022, 7:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yep
10/09/2022, 7:12 pm - +91 81056 35154: Even atlassian ig did that
10/09/2022, 7:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Everything else was a bonus that wasn't guaranteed
10/09/2022, 7:12 pm - +91 81056 35154: I have had a case with an iit Guwahati student as well who came to Cisco
10/09/2022, 7:13 pm - +91 81056 35154: He got 42 lakh package with 18 base and he didn't like the work also that Amazon gave him
10/09/2022, 7:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: For those here who don't understand, CTC is the total package amount you *potentially* can cost the company. Base pay is what you will *definitely* be paid at the end of each year. Ideally you want base pay ≈ CTC
10/09/2022, 7:13 pm - +91 99456 67559: very few companies have this structure right?
10/09/2022, 7:13 pm - +91 81056 35154: Lmao the last statement is quite impossible considering you are getting stocks , signing bonus and benefits
10/09/2022, 7:13 pm - +91 99456 67559: unless u referring to witch companies 🤡
10/09/2022, 7:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Because if it isn't, then bonuses (these aren't guaranteed) fill up the remaining amount. Things like relocation bonus, sign on bonus, performance bonus, 4 year completion etc)
10/09/2022, 7:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah, I'm just saying what you should try to maximise
10/09/2022, 7:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: You always try to maximise the guaranteed amount
10/09/2022, 7:14 pm - +91 81056 35154: Yea
10/09/2022, 7:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: All these bonuses are there but they're never guaranteed
10/09/2022, 7:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: Relocation bonus won't be given to you if you're in the same city as the office. Considering the fact that we're in Bangalore over 90% of us won't be eligible
10/09/2022, 7:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: Some have a 4 year completion bonus. A lot of us will work for 2-3 years and then leave for Masters or switch.
10/09/2022, 7:15 pm - +91 81056 35154: Lmao every companies will give u high CTC and low base because they want profit , they can't afford to give away huge bases for a fresher and afaik in india in any IT company u can't get a base more than 22-25 lakhs
10/09/2022, 7:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah, so when you see PES print news saying the highest salary offered is 65 LPA or something, the base is probably 25-30 max
10/09/2022, 7:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: No company will pay freshers that much
10/09/2022, 7:16 pm - +91 81056 35154: True
10/09/2022, 7:17 pm - +91 81056 35154: And this hype lures students to take up cs and do jobs
10/09/2022, 7:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: To increase the CTC they'll just add more bonuses which in all probability will never be met
10/09/2022, 7:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yep
10/09/2022, 7:17 pm - +91 81056 35154: and from this it goes to the hype that iit/nit are made for making one eligible to get such packages
10/09/2022, 7:18 pm - +91 81056 35154: And this is how the system runs in india
10/09/2022, 7:18 pm - Aditeya Baral: At the end of the day you're being lured by one party or the other
10/09/2022, 7:18 pm - Aditeya Baral: Education, Profession
10/09/2022, 7:19 pm - +91 81056 35154: Yep and in 98% cases of the people have ended up doing a job which they might not like but getting fat ctc which others believ to be the money they get yearly
10/09/2022, 7:21 pm - +91 80884 07523: Advertising, the gift that keeps giving
10/09/2022, 7:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: Is anyone a part of the alcoding contest on hackerrank?

16/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 96320 07839: See tat would have been the case
Had it been PESU just taking PESSAT score like Manipal
But we are taking CET ranks also no
So there's a decent possibility we might close for a while
Again my view
Can be wrong
16/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 78922 40050: <Media omitted>
16/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 79756 56645: That possibility shld be less than 0.000000001%
16/09/2022, 6:56 pm - +91 96320 07839: But it's der

16/09/2022, 6:57 pm - +91 96061 40554: Either close or don't, keeping it online is 🤢
16/09/2022, 6:57 pm - +91 90197 96534: Exactly

16/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 6361 631 974: So they don't have a reason to stop
16/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 79756 56645: Pes is deemed right?
16/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 78922 40050: ☠️☠️😭

16/09/2022, 6:59 pm - +91 78922 40050: Apparently dayanand Sagar is also autonomous
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 96320 07839: So it comes under VTU
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 98804 78855: That's also deemed to be uni
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 79756 56645: That's dayanand Sagar university. Not dsce
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 96320 07839: Like degree will be from VTU at least
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 6361 631 974: If DS stopped then pes has a valid reason to stop classes too
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 82870 36683: But pes doesn't come under VTU
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 96061 40554: How does it matter if it's under vtu?
16/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +91 79756 56645: Bruh u don't want to come to offline classes?

16/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 79756 56645: Bruh i just don't want online.
16/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 96061 40554: Ik that pes doesn't come under vtu, but doesn't that still mean that they have to listen to the government if they tell them to stop classes?
16/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 96320 07839: Same
16/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 78922 40050: Autonomous means not under vtu
16/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 74066 31225: Pes>>>>> govt
16/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 96320 07839: Don't think so dude..
16/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 96320 07839: 😌
16/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 80734 96504: the whole point of not keeping college is so that kcet ppl dont lag behind
16/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 96061 40554: Then again pes can say that they've kept a whole other batch for kcet students so...

17/09/2022, 9:43 am - Aditeya Baral: They did something similar for us during COVID and they justified it saying "shutting down the college was advisory but not mandatory"

17/09/2022, 9:59 am - +91 72900 58727: It does have a credit tho...it literally says so in the app
17/09/2022, 10:00 am - +91 90197 96534: Ah for me it says NC
17/09/2022, 10:00 am - +91 99014 37680: You'll have isa and esa
17/09/2022, 10:00 am - +91 90197 96534: My bad

17/09/2022, 10:01 am - +91 98867 39499: 😢👍
17/09/2022, 10:02 am - Aditeya Baral: That is not possible xD
17/09/2022, 10:02 am - Aditeya Baral: It's mostly 1 credit.
17/09/2022, 10:03 am - Aditeya Baral: If you have classes for a course, that course has credits
17/09/2022, 10:03 am - Aditeya Baral: Since you had 1 hour this week (I'm assuming) of it, it's a 1 credit course
17/09/2022, 10:03 am - +91 96636 57446: Yeah
17/09/2022, 10:08 am - +91 72900 58727: NC is meant to stand for online classes I believe, not no credit
17/09/2022, 10:08 am - +91 83101 02383: wait we have seniors in this group?!
17/09/2022, 10:09 am - +91 81056 35154: NC is non credited course
17/09/2022, 10:09 am - Aditeya Baral: NC literally stands for no credit though. NC courses don't have classes
17/09/2022, 10:09 am - +91 83101 02383: ohhhh
17/09/2022, 10:09 am - Aditeya Baral: An NC course doesn't have ISA or ESA. It has a 30 min scam test where if you show up, you pass regardless of your score.
17/09/2022, 10:10 am - +91 83101 02383: We don't have any NCs tho
17/09/2022, 10:10 am - Aditeya Baral: But this is a 1 credit course you have, so you'll have ISA/ESA as well
17/09/2022, 10:10 am - Aditeya Baral: Normal like other courses
17/09/2022, 10:10 am - Aditeya Baral: Yeah, just explaining the difference
17/09/2022, 10:12 am - +91 83101 02383: cool cool
17/09/2022, 10:13 am - +91 72900 58727: Okay then, what's FC?
17/09/2022, 10:13 am - +91 81056 35154: Foundation course
17/09/2022, 10:14 am - Aditeya Baral: Foundation course if I remember, usually 4 credits and consist of the non elective and non optional courses
17/09/2022, 10:14 am - Aditeya Baral: Later when you have electives, they'll be called EC, or elective course

25/09/2022, 12:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: no chance
25/09/2022, 12:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: they can finish your sem only along with cet dudes also
25/09/2022, 12:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: so it might go on until Feb
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - +91 79756 56645: Every sem has how many isas?
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - +91 80884 07523: Sad
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - +91 99014 37680: 5 i guess
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Courses x 5
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - +91 99014 37680: we had 2 last year
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Oh that way, then yeah 5 ISAs per sem
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Except final year
25/09/2022, 12:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: 2 ISAs per sem
25/09/2022, 12:04 pm - +91 99028 64009: They made it 5 for 1st years also from this year
25/09/2022, 12:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: Ahh L
25/09/2022, 12:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: it's too hard
25/09/2022, 12:04 pm - +91 78922 40050: Usually one sem is how long?
25/09/2022, 12:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Tbh from whatever I heard from people, each ISA has become easier but it's way more hectic now
25/09/2022, 12:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Usually, Aug-Dec and Jan-May
25/09/2022, 12:05 pm - +91 99014 37680: i have no idea
first sem was 6 months
second was 3
25/09/2022, 12:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah your batch was screwed up
25/09/2022, 12:05 pm - +91 99014 37680: true true
but the questions being asked are also *very* tricky now
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 99014 37680: so you'll spend minimum 5+ minutes per question and still not get answer
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah but it used to be harder just saying 😂
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 99014 37680: i liked the 2 isa one 🗿
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: Getting 20s out of 40 used to be the average score 😂😂😂
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 99014 37680: it was just mugging up from one week ago
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 99028 64009: Ours they can't possibly do that
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 99014 37680: it's PES
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: I doubt it'll be like that, they'll make life hell for CET kids
25/09/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 99028 64009: How can they finish 5 isa in 3 months
25/09/2022, 12:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: PES won't exceed a semester timeline by more than one month again
25/09/2022, 12:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: Causes delays
25/09/2022, 12:07 pm - +91 99028 64009: Especially if it's 3 weeks per isa
25/09/2022, 12:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: They'll make it 4 months max, not more
25/09/2022, 12:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or else they'll cut it down to 2 weeks
25/09/2022, 12:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: The current final years had an ISA every alternate week
25/09/2022, 12:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: They got some time off towards the end of the sem when there were no more tests
25/09/2022, 12:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Looks like they made it 3 weeks to balance out that time at the end
25/09/2022, 12:08 pm - +91 99028 64009: But last year is 2 isa a sem you told right
25/09/2022, 12:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Talking about their previous sems
25/09/2022, 12:09 pm - +91 99028 64009: Oh
25/09/2022, 12:09 pm - +91 79756 56645: How are they going to finish 5 isas before dec?
25/09/2022, 12:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: They won't. Your semester started late, expect it to end in Jan
25/09/2022, 12:09 pm - +91 79756 56645: Ohh
25/09/2022, 12:09 pm - +91 79756 56645: Bruh so no holidays also 😢
25/09/2022, 12:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: You guys still didn't get your calendar?
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - +91 79756 56645: No
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - +91 78922 40050: If ours is late then what about kcet☠️
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - +91 79756 56645: I checked in app. It showed as no data available
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Actually makes sense, without knowing when all CET kids will join they can't form a calendar
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: That app never updates
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: It used to, before COVID
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: But now it doesn't
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: They send one email out
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - +91 78922 40050: Well atleast the final decision has been made
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - +91 78922 40050: Counselling from oct 3
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Same time as you
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Their batch is separate, but ESA will happen at the same time
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - +91 79756 56645: Kcet counseling and pessat round 2 counselling also shld be done
25/09/2022, 12:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yes huh
25/09/2022, 12:11 pm - +91 82176 41294: Fast and furious
25/09/2022, 12:11 pm - +91 82176 41294: We are going to get stuff lagged till they come
25/09/2022, 12:11 pm - +91 82176 41294: Then they are going to pass through hell in PES and still be in same level as us
25/09/2022, 12:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: PES usually waits for max 1-2 rounds of CET counseling before they start classes
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: I remember back in my first year some CET kids joined in my second and third week too
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - +91 79756 56645: Will 2nd year be a bit better than this??
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: So they'll wait for like one round before starting
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Isn't it just your second week xD
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: You have 4 years to go
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
25/09/2022, 12:12 pm - +91 82176 41294: Last time ISA for 1st week was postponed a lot
25/09/2022, 12:13 pm - +91 82176 41294: This message was deleted
25/09/2022, 12:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Regardless, 2nd year will start on time. Normal session timings. Aug-Dec and Jan-May. June, July, and 1-2 weeks of August are summer vacation. About 2 weeks for December vacation
25/09/2022, 12:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or rather, *should* start on time
25/09/2022, 12:13 pm - +91 78922 40050: But that's not actually vacation because we have to do summer internships right
25/09/2022, 12:14 pm - +91 82176 41294: Not compulsory right
25/09/2022, 12:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: I mean yes, there isn't a summer "break" anymore. But you don't have to do
25/09/2022, 12:14 pm - +91 99028 64009: 1st year atleast we can enjoy a bit bro from second year it kinda become mandatory
25/09/2022, 12:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: Besides companies will rarely hire first year kids. You'll find opportunities on campus though
25/09/2022, 12:15 pm - +91 79756 56645: Totally how many days holiday u get??
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: About 3 months of total holiday in a year
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - +91 78922 40050: Summer and during December that's all ig
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: 2 weeks + 2.5 months
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: PES gives way lesser holidays during the year
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - +91 78922 40050: That's actually pretty decent
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: And instead gives a large summer break
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: IMO, is more useful
25/09/2022, 12:16 pm - +91 79756 56645: Ohh
25/09/2022, 12:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: Helps you pursue other stuff during summer/travel
25/09/2022, 12:17 pm - +91 6361 631 974: That's way more efficient and we also get a bigger break
25/09/2022, 12:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah
25/09/2022, 12:18 pm - Aditeya Baral: You can spend your time well in the summer learning things or get an internship
25/09/2022, 12:18 pm - Aditeya Baral: Essentially, it's a lot of time so people don't waste it
25/09/2022, 12:18 pm - +91 79756 56645: Imo?
25/09/2022, 12:19 pm - Aditeya Baral: In my opinion

26/09/2022, 9:03 pm - +91 78993 01497: Hello, from *_EnactusPESU!_*

This is your chance to show us what you’ve got if you’re a _problem-solver_ and are willing to _square the circle!_

Join us at our flagship event-
*_ENgenious’22_*
Ideate,
Innovate,
and,
Invigorate! 

All you need to do is _brainstorm a problem statement_, _build a team_ (of 3-4 participants), and bring as much _grit_ and _passion_ to the table as possible!

We’re looking at *4 rounds*,
and *30 teams.*
*_Round 1_* will require the teams to work on *pitch decks* that entail the _problem statement, the solution_, the _USP_ , and its relevance in terms of working towards a _social cause_.

*_Round 2_* will take place for about 90 minutes. The teams will be expected to *work on a BMC* (Business Model Canvas). A brief overview of what a BMC is, and how it’s drafted will be provided beforehand. 

*_Round 3_* will provide a platform for each of the teams to *propose a budget* that they deem necessary for their respective projects, and justify the same. 

Based on these 3 rounds, 
The panel will consolidate the scores, after which, the *top 10 teams* will be eligible for the final round. 

*_The final round_* is when the teams get to _tweak, and modify their existing pitch decks_, are expected to bring their A game in terms of their _spontaneity_ and _critical thinking skills_, while _accommodating the budget_ allocated to them previously. 
Following which, they get to present their *final pitch.*

*_The winners_* will not only win *exciting prizes* but will also *stand a chance to directly find themselves for the interview round pertaining to the EnactusPESU recruitments*!

An event like this is an opportunity that you wouldn’t want to miss! 
_Come join us, put your best foot forward, and hone your *entrepreneurial and problem-solving skills* while you’re at it!_

We look forward to your participation!

26/09/2022, 9:50 pm - +91 91132 16705: Will they give a problem statement or do we have to come up with one?
26/09/2022, 9:51 pm - +91 82176 41294: No idea
26/09/2022, 9:51 pm - +91 82176 41294: Got it sent it
26/09/2022, 9:51 pm - +91 99014 37680: bruv it literally says brainstorm a problem statement
26/09/2022, 10:33 pm - +91 99014 37680: Hey my dudes, what functionalities do you want the PES app or website to have which is currently not in it?
26/09/2022, 10:34 pm - +91 97402 68078: PDFs in the app instead of making us go to the website?
26/09/2022, 10:34 pm - +91 99014 37680: i'm trying to make something like a Better PES Website
26/09/2022, 10:44 pm - +91 81056 35154: The reference section is empty for quite a lot of sections in the subject
26/09/2022, 10:45 pm - +91 81056 35154: and would want other referce videos or info for further knowledge, let's say we learn spectroscopy, a link which the takes us to how spectroscopy can be used in future or further mathematical application, further knowledge section or reference links for that
26/09/2022, 10:45 pm - +91 99014 37680: also my dudes, just wanted to clarify, my friends and I wanted to make changes the *website* only
26/09/2022, 10:45 pm - +91 81056 35154: Just the UI ?
26/09/2022, 10:45 pm - +91 99014 37680: no no
26/09/2022, 10:45 pm - +91 99014 37680: not just UI
26/09/2022, 10:46 pm - +91 99014 37680: anything
26/09/2022, 10:46 pm - +91 99014 37680: we'll try what we can change
26/09/2022, 10:46 pm - +91 99014 37680: just taking suggestions
26/09/2022, 10:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: That is because teachers do not update it
26/09/2022, 10:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not exactly a "website" bug/shortcoming
26/09/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 81056 35154: Kk
26/09/2022, 11:05 pm - +91 91087 96229: Where r u gonna get access to their APIs from?
26/09/2022, 11:05 pm - +91 91087 96229: Their internal ones
26/09/2022, 11:05 pm - +91 91087 96229: Used to query their DBs
26/09/2022, 11:05 pm - +91 99014 37680: not sure
gonna think of something
26/09/2022, 11:06 pm - +91 99014 37680: we need to make web tech mini project
26/09/2022, 11:06 pm - +91 91087 96229: Starting the project w/o thinking about this would be a pretty L move tbh
26/09/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 99014 37680: i've made plenty of L moves
26/09/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 91087 96229: Coz their APIs would be the bottleneck in ur design not ur skill
26/09/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 99014 37680: this won't be any different
26/09/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 91087 96229: Okboss good luck
26/09/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 91087 96229: Anirudh and I have tried already
26/09/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 91087 96229: Good luck
26/09/2022, 11:08 pm - +91 99014 37680: tried what?
26/09/2022, 11:08 pm - +91 91087 96229: What u r doing rn
26/09/2022, 11:08 pm - +91 91087 96229: We wanted to do it as well a couple of weeks ago
26/09/2022, 11:09 pm - +91 99014 37680: ohh F
26/09/2022, 11:10 pm - +91 91087 96229: By anirudh I mean icarus
26/09/2022, 11:12 pm - +91 99014 37680: i don't know who that is
and i was confused because my name is also Anirudh
26/09/2022, 11:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: I doubt you can get these
26/09/2022, 11:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: We tried a few years ago too
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: The only thing that we were able to bypass at one point is the hall ticket page - we were able to download anyone's hall ticket
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: But then they realised something was querying their hall tickets
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: And they fixed it 🥲
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: But you would get an html page as a response rather than a json object rute
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: Rite*
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: What should happen is that u recieve the data and then render it
26/09/2022, 11:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: For which u need access to internal apis
26/09/2022, 11:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: Ofc u have this too
26/09/2022, 11:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup, it wasn't exactly an API
26/09/2022, 11:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: Rather than extracting data from a rendered page
26/09/2022, 11:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: It rendered the PDF and we simply downloaded it
26/09/2022, 11:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: We added it to the PESU Academy discord bot
26/09/2022, 11:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Was pretty fast, people just typed in SRN and it gave them their hall ticket pretty quickly
26/09/2022, 11:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Although wasn't exactly an important feature lol
26/09/2022, 11:23 pm - +91 99014 37680: Aight
thanks for the heads up ✌️
27/09/2022, 7:57 am - +91 78297 70134: If you could put everything in the pes media server on your website that'd be nice

08/10/2022, 7:46 pm - +91 90197 96534: Does PES have absolute or relative grading system?
08/10/2022, 7:46 pm - +91 88846 19998: Depends on the teacher is what I've heard
08/10/2022, 7:46 pm - +91 80734 96504: Does PES have absolute or relative grading system?
08/10/2022, 7:48 pm - +91 90366 74925: Wht , how ?💀
08/10/2022, 7:48 pm - +91 97406 94534: Trolling?
08/10/2022, 7:49 pm - +91 88846 19998: Apparently your teacher can pick if they want to assign grades on a relative scale or absolute scale depending on your class's performance
08/10/2022, 7:50 pm - +91 80734 96504: No
08/10/2022, 7:50 pm - +91 90366 74925: Won't that just be unfair in some cases?
08/10/2022, 7:50 pm - +91 97406 94534: Ah alright
08/10/2022, 7:50 pm - +91 97406 94534: Does PES have absolute or relative grading system?
08/10/2022, 7:50 pm - +91 88846 19998: How
08/10/2022, 7:51 pm - +91 90197 96534: Genuine query
08/10/2022, 7:51 pm - +91 80734 96504: Genuine query
08/10/2022, 7:51 pm - +91 97406 94534: Genuine query
08/10/2022, 7:54 pm - +91 78922 40050: It's absolute system only I think
08/10/2022, 7:54 pm - +91 88846 19998: I don't think so
08/10/2022, 7:55 pm - +91 88846 19998: It was absolute a few years back
08/10/2022, 7:55 pm - +91 88846 19998: Like 2017 I believe
08/10/2022, 7:56 pm - +91 95084 21687: NOOOOOOOOO
08/10/2022, 7:56 pm - +91 95084 21687: Relative.Like JEE Percentile
08/10/2022, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's absolute
08/10/2022, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Atleast that's the short answer
08/10/2022, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Long answer, it's unknown, PES has its own method that it uses that isn't completely transparent
08/10/2022, 7:57 pm - +91 90197 96534: Thx a lot
08/10/2022, 7:57 pm - +91 80734 96504: Thx a lot
08/10/2022, 7:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's close to absolute, but in some cases we've noticed it tends to get relative (especially for courses that the entire batch screws up in)
08/10/2022, 7:58 pm - +91 88846 19998: Do you get to know your marks??
08/10/2022, 7:58 pm - +91 88846 19998: Very fun...
08/10/2022, 7:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: Nope
08/10/2022, 8:14 pm - +91 97406 94534: null
08/10/2022, 8:14 pm - +91 88846 19998: Hmm...very shady
08/10/2022, 8:15 pm - +91 88846 19998: What if you want to dispute your answers??
08/10/2022, 8:15 pm - +91 88846 19998: Since the ESA is subjective and carries a lot of weight weightage
08/10/2022, 8:15 pm - +91 88846 19998: Ignore the weight*
08/10/2022, 8:19 pm - Aditeya Baral: So at the end of a semester there is a review period
08/10/2022, 8:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: There are 2 kinds - 

1. They recheck your paper
2. You can view your paper for yourself and then raise a request
08/10/2022, 8:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Both cost money. If your grade changes (not marks, entire grade has to change), then you get a refund
08/10/2022, 8:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: I don't remember the cost anymore. I think it was 1k for each course for rechecking and 2k for viewing your paper
08/10/2022, 8:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not sure though
08/10/2022, 8:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also this only applies to 4 credit courses - so no 2 credit courses, labs, quizzes, assignments, projects and any other things that are less than 4 credits
08/10/2022, 8:24 pm - +91 88846 19998: MAD okay
08/10/2022, 8:24 pm - +91 88846 19998: Take the L that's all nevermind
08/10/2022, 8:24 pm - +91 81056 35154: money ? Da fuq
08/10/2022, 8:26 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah it's a pretty expensive thing to do for multiple courses xD
08/10/2022, 8:26 pm - Aditeya Baral: Most people just opt for the first option (unless there is a major difference between what you got and what you expected)
08/10/2022, 8:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: Personally, I've never applied for it, so I don't really have any extra information regarding the process that follows after you submit the application and make the payment
08/10/2022, 8:27 pm - +91 78922 40050: Yeah most colleges you gotta pay
08/10/2022, 8:28 pm - +91 99727 85742: Understandable

Cost tho👀
Ig to prevent from everyone checking
08/10/2022, 8:28 pm - +91 90366 74925: Paying to just look at my own paper 💀
08/10/2022, 8:28 pm - Aditeya Baral: Oh also, there are 2 options if I remember correctly for viewing your paper
08/10/2022, 8:28 pm - Aditeya Baral: One is a soft copy and one is the actual copy
08/10/2022, 8:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: This was introduced during COVID
08/10/2022, 8:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: Idk if it's there anymore, before COVID it was always the original copy
08/10/2022, 8:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: So if you opted for the soft copy, you would have access to it only from the lab systems, and only for 1 hour
08/10/2022, 8:30 pm - Aditeya Baral: Physical copy also same, but you'd have to visit the place where this process happens
08/10/2022, 8:30 pm - +91 79750 80168: Price fr soft copy?
08/10/2022, 8:32 pm - Aditeya Baral: Don't remember anymore
08/10/2022, 8:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: Wait you guys haven't even given your first ISA right
08/10/2022, 8:33 pm - +91 79750 80168: Ah it's fine, thanks for all the information anyways🙏
08/10/2022, 8:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: Why are you all worrying about ESA paper rechecking 😂😂😂
08/10/2022, 8:33 pm - +91 74839 03348: 😂
08/10/2022, 8:36 pm - +91 99456 67559: planning 100
08/10/2022, 8:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: One thing that helps out in PES is focusing on what's currently on your plate. 

Each semester is extremely long and tiring with 30+ ISAs and 5-6 assignments and projects, labs etc. All this gets very draining and honestly will damage your mental health the more you think about it and how you'll do.

Just focus on what's next for now and take things slowly. It honestly makes things a little better
08/10/2022, 8:47 pm - +91 99456 67559: i go to college everyday with the sole intention of not attracting attention from teachers, studies atm is a different topic altogether
08/10/2022, 8:47 pm - +91 79750 80168: Thanks a lot for the advice bro, you are the most helpful senior here🙏
08/10/2022, 9:05 pm - +91 97408 01717: Anyone know what is the portion for constitution? Till where do we have to read in the pdf?
08/10/2022, 9:06 pm - +91 99456 67559: when we asked he just replied we have class next week and ended the call 😭
08/10/2022, 9:13 pm - +91 97408 01717: until which page have they finished (in the pdf) can you pls tell me
08/10/2022, 9:28 pm - +91 72900 58727: God bless
08/10/2022, 9:47 pm - +91 99456 67559: I honestly have no idea
08/10/2022, 9:50 pm - +91 78993 01497: Makes sense to take money ‘cause otherwise everyone will want to recheck it

12/10/2022, 8:49 pm - +91 88612 61394: For ISA they will pick 4 out of 5 right ? 
So is it picked like out of 5 phy paper best four and same like that for each subject or is it  the 4 best ISA's taken out of 5 . If in some case u did bad in phy in 1st ISA and did everything else good 
And in 2nd ISA u did everything else good except math and in  isa 3,4,5 all good then will they take my phy from 2nd isa and 4subjects from 1st isa and 3,4,5
12/10/2022, 8:52 pm - +91 82870 36683: It'll be like out of 5 phy papers best 4 will be taken and same for all subjects
12/10/2022, 8:53 pm - +91 82870 36683: Each subject 5 ISA out of those 5 best 4 will be taken

12/10/2022, 9:48 pm - +91 89054 72730: They’ll count total marks of all subjects in one ISA and like that five scores will be there
12/10/2022, 9:48 pm - +91 89054 72730: Out of which best four will be considered
12/10/2022, 10:02 pm - +91 78922 40050: Nah it's subject wise ig

12/10/2022, 11:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: From whatever I heard, it's subject wise
12/10/2022, 11:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: But I could be wrong as well so get it confirmed
12/10/2022, 11:06 pm - +91 72900 58727: For an institute that likes to flex a 100% pass-out rate, I'd be surprised if it wasn't best 4 of 5 subject-wise
12/10/2022, 11:07 pm - +91 88612 61394: I will get it confirmed
12/10/2022, 11:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: Bold of you to assume that it is actually 100%
12/10/2022, 11:24 pm - +91 96061 40554: Subject wise makes the most sense
12/10/2022, 11:25 pm - +91 96061 40554: I mean that's the point of having ISAs like this, to maximize gpa right

10/12/2022, 11:21 pm - +91 99014 37680: hey guys, just wanted to let you k that we have gotten the green light for the chess club. It will commence its activities from the next sem. We wanted to announce after the ESAs but seeing the buzz thought should make an unoffical one here. 
This is a big step towards a great great journey!
We suggest you guys focus on ESA's for the time being. If you wish to spread the word you can.
Information such as recruitments and events will be released in next sem itself.
in the mean time feel free to follow the insta page @castlechess_pesu.

11/12/2022, 12:54 pm - +91 82966 96682: i mean they said during orientation that metro station is only 500m away from the college how could you believe it when they said they would give us proper holidays

11/12/2022, 12:55 pm - +91 83103 70225: 😆
11/12/2022, 12:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: Usually is, but for that your semester needs to start in August :)
11/12/2022, 12:55 pm - +91 90197 96534: But that also isn't 500m ig lol
11/12/2022, 12:55 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ahh
11/12/2022, 12:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Aug-Dec and Jan-May are normal session timings
11/12/2022, 12:56 pm - +91 83103 70225: Walkable they mentioned,
11/12/2022, 12:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: The last 2 years have seen delays because of COVID for first year batches. Remaining batches have had normal >2 months of yearly break
11/12/2022, 12:57 pm - +91 94984 76291: Yeah that's like 2km ig
11/12/2022, 12:57 pm - +91 83103 70225: Guys we forgot about the fking freshers
11/12/2022, 12:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Aren't y'all freshers
11/12/2022, 12:57 pm - +91 94984 76291: So by second year we will have normal holiday given?
11/12/2022, 12:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah
11/12/2022, 12:57 pm - +91 94984 76291: I see
11/12/2022, 12:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: 2.5 months for summer break, and about 10 days for December
11/12/2022, 12:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: 10-12
11/12/2022, 12:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: *10-12 days
11/12/2022, 12:58 pm - +91 94984 76291: Ooh okay
11/12/2022, 12:58 pm - +91 94984 76291: Thanks
11/12/2022, 12:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Your summer break is usually between last week of May to first week of August
11/12/2022, 12:59 pm - +91 83103 70225: Party
11/12/2022, 12:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Still have hopes huh
11/12/2022, 12:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Cute
11/12/2022, 12:59 pm - +91 94984 76291: Damnn
11/12/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 94984 76291: So since ours will start at march and end  at July we won't get any yearly break

11/12/2022, 1:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: They'll probably give you like a week

11/12/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 94984 76291: They giving us a week for odd sem
11/12/2022, 1:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: But yeah, ideally they'll want to start on time or close to on time so there isn't further delay
11/12/2022, 1:01 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lol all of this is reminding me of narayana
11/12/2022, 1:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: Because if every semester starts and ends late then it's an issue
11/12/2022, 1:01 pm - +91 83103 70225: Yeah
11/12/2022, 1:01 pm - +91 94984 76291: I see
11/12/2022, 1:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: So expect your first actual "normal" college year to be 2nd year
11/12/2022, 1:01 pm - +91 94984 76291: Damnn
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Normal number of days between tests, number of holidays etc
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Right now everything for your batch is messed up
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - +91 94984 76291: Do we choose electives in 2nd year or third
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Third
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - +91 90197 96534: Which will have 10 assignments per unit?
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - +91 94984 76291: 😢
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - +91 94984 76291: Damn
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - +91 94984 76291: So what happens in 2nd year usually
11/12/2022, 1:02 pm - +91 99456 67559: including ourselves
11/12/2022, 1:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: My batch wasn't part of the 5 ISA system, so idk how many assignments they have per course. But yeah it's about 3-4 I think. But each course also has labs + project
11/12/2022, 1:03 pm - +91 97418 00513: This ain't school y'all
11/12/2022, 1:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: So I guess if you add up all side deliverables it'll be around 10
11/12/2022, 1:03 pm - +91 97418 00513: Don't expect more than 10 days or max 15 days
11/12/2022, 1:03 pm - +91 97418 00513: There also summer programs and internships
11/12/2022, 1:04 pm - +91 90197 96534: Nice
11/12/2022, 1:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: You enter your branches. You will have courses only on your major. Most of them are introductory courses needed for heavier stuff in third hear
11/12/2022, 1:04 pm - +91 94984 76291: Ahh okay
11/12/2022, 1:05 pm - +91 94984 76291: So is 2nd year more lighter than first year?
11/12/2022, 1:05 pm - +91 94984 76291: Like in curriculum
11/12/2022, 1:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: Every year gets heavier
11/12/2022, 1:06 pm - +91 94984 76291: Damn 😢
11/12/2022, 1:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: Courses will be arguably harder, more deliverables, assignments, labs aren't as simple as writing 10-15 line code snippets, projects require you to do proper work and have strict plagiarism checks across campuses
11/12/2022, 1:07 pm - +91 94984 76291: Oof
11/12/2022, 1:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also if you're in CS don't plagiarise code from 2nd year lmao. It's actually pretty hilarious when you see what people do to avoid plagiarism because it all gets flagged
11/12/2022, 1:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: I was a teaching assistant, I had access to the plagiarism checker and worked on it too. You can't beat it unless you write vastly different code
11/12/2022, 1:08 pm - +91 94984 76291: They use sublit or something right
11/12/2022, 1:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: That's the submission platform
11/12/2022, 1:09 pm - +91 94984 76291: Damn what the hell
11/12/2022, 1:09 pm - +91 94984 76291: Ahh okay
11/12/2022, 1:09 pm - +91 94984 76291: I heard it was created by pes students
11/12/2022, 1:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup
11/12/2022, 1:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: 2023 batch

We welcome you to the 9th edition of the annual exhibition of the projects carried out by the student interns of the 8-week summer internship program conducted during the months of Jun-July 2022. These interns were selected after a rigorous selection process based on their project ideas, skills and interviews, after an online screening test. A number of projects on contemporary and industry relevant topics were chosen and carried out by groups of students of different backgrounds, branches and seniority under the mentorship of senior interns of the lab.

This Roadshow event serves as an excellent opportunity for prospective interns to get inspired and learn more about the activities & events conducted by the lab as well as details on how to be a part of the lab. The domains of these projects include Robotics, Sensor Networks, Machine Learning, Web & App Development and Distributed Computing.

Venue: 3rd Floor, Be Block
Date: 24th January 2023
Time: 10:15AM - 5:30PM

04/02/2023, 9:53 am - +91 99014 37680: Yes
04/02/2023, 9:54 am - +91 97317 42338: But I got a notification saying my registration wasn't complete😂
04/02/2023, 9:54 am - +91 95358 33858: Yah bro same here
04/02/2023, 9:55 am - +91 95358 33858: What about the other options .. Drop and withdrawn
04/02/2023, 9:55 am - +91 97317 42338: That's what even I was wondering
04/02/2023, 9:55 am - +91 95358 33858: Then wt to do
04/02/2023, 9:56 am - +91 97317 42338: No idea, what is the difference btw withdraw and drop in the first place?
04/02/2023, 9:57 am - +91 97317 42338: Anyone else who finished the registration?
04/02/2023, 9:57 am - +91 90197 96534: Ye same here
04/02/2023, 9:58 am - +91 99014 37680: Don't know
But don't do it
04/02/2023, 9:58 am - +91 97317 42338: Who do we contact in this case
04/02/2023, 10:00 am - +91 78297 70134: Everyone got that I think
04/02/2023, 10:00 am - +91 78297 70134: don't worry too much about it
04/02/2023, 10:00 am - +91 97317 42338: Oh ok
04/02/2023, 10:01 am - +91 98451 84874: If you want to,
Contact the HOD..
However don't worry abt it
04/02/2023, 10:06 am - Aditeya Baral: Don't click on that
04/02/2023, 10:07 am - Aditeya Baral: Oh this bug is always there. Essentially once you register the option to unregister is always there, so it keeps sending the notification
04/02/2023, 10:07 am - +91 98865 40368: Click on that and forgot second sem
04/02/2023, 10:08 am - Aditeya Baral: Withdraw will allow you to give the exam later in the summer or any other time
Drop is permanent. If you drop a course you won't have another chance at it
04/02/2023, 10:08 am - Aditeya Baral: Atleast if I remember correctly this is the thing
04/02/2023, 10:08 am - Aditeya Baral: Essentially, stay away from those 2 options
04/02/2023, 10:20 am - +91 96638 05552: What if most ppl decide to withdraw?.... Is there a chance at esa getting postponed then?
04/02/2023, 10:22 am - Aditeya Baral: Lmao no
04/02/2023, 10:24 am - +91 99014 37680: Wishful thinking😂
04/02/2023, 10:24 am - +91 73532 91375: So when u drop a subject so it means ur grade for that subject is 0?
04/02/2023, 10:27 am - +91 80508 84296: ig it means you won't get graded for it and will loose the credits it gives
04/02/2023, 10:28 am - Aditeya Baral: Nope, it'll be like you didn't have that course at all
04/02/2023, 10:29 am - +91 82176 41294: Well I didn't have another option other than both of those
04/02/2023, 10:33 am - +91 73532 91375: Woah..
04/02/2023, 10:34 am - Aditeya Baral: Which also means you'll be lacking credits to graduate

04/02/2023, 10:46 am - +91 96063 43985: Passing gets you all the credits for the course

06/02/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 73389 36843: so just use firefox with ubo
06/02/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 97406 94534: Ok
06/02/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 73389 36843: unless you are bothered by it being half a second slower than blink engine based browsers
06/02/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 73389 36843: then just use chromium with ubo
06/02/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 97406 94534: Ok
06/02/2023, 8:59 pm - +91 94495 71975: pfp checks out 🫡
06/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 93537 16080: Yeah, and take it a step further by using pihole as well
06/02/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yes, pihole if you really want to. Most of the times ubo works just fine, and when you arent at home you have no other choice sadly 😔
06/02/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 93537 16080: I have a wireguard server too, so I pretty much have pihole to do my DNS queries everywhere
06/02/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 85537 17575: Ublock is the best for people on the go since u cant bring a pi along everywhere with u.
06/02/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 73389 36843: That is pretty cool, how does it affect speeds?
06/02/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 93537 16080: Yeah and pihole can't do YouTube ads
06/02/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yep
06/02/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 93537 16080: Its capped to the pi's max network speed or your network speed whichever is lower, plus a 10-15% hit
06/02/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 73389 36843: ah
06/02/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 73389 36843: Fair enough. I personally would not sacrifice that speed for the pihole, ubo my beloved
06/02/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 73389 36843: Important question, how does it work in the campus
06/02/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 93537 16080: Cannot be used with pes WiFi at all lol
06/02/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 73389 36843: Ah i thought so

11/02/2023, 5:07 pm - +91 97390 95035: "Pay more so that you're eligible to pay less"

11/02/2023, 6:11 pm - +91 90199 42460: 'education for the real world'
11/02/2023, 6:13 pm - +91 77188 25988: So basically pay extra 10K to be eligible for scholarship 💀

Bruh are they running a lottery business or what?
11/02/2023, 6:14 pm - +91 94495 71975: yes
11/02/2023, 6:18 pm - Aditeya Baral: More like you funding someone else's scholarship
11/02/2023, 6:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: They're crowdsourcing the money for scholarships so that the amount they have to pay from their own pockets is less
11/02/2023, 6:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Can't lose too much money now that there's more students
11/02/2023, 6:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Do you atleast get the 10k back if you don't get the scholarship?
11/02/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 94495 71975: no
11/02/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 77188 25988: We're still paying 4.1 Lac tho 💀
11/02/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 77188 25988: Prob not
11/02/2023, 6:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah I'd probably run away from home if I paid 10k for a scholarship and then didn't get it
11/02/2023, 6:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Atleast back then your parents would tell you to work harder next time. Can't tell dad that you blew 10k on an imaginary scholarship
11/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fun Fact : you don't get a refund if you never win anything
11/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: Pretty sure that "scholarship" is coming from the 10k "registration" fees the rest of us peasants will pay
11/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: You do realise a casino works the same way?

11/02/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 94495 71975: yeah
11/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Is the top 15% considered only for those who have registered or is it considered taking in people who haven't registered as well?
11/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 94495 71975: its considers all ppl
11/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 94495 71975: 💀
11/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ahh ☠️
11/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 78297 70134: always choose worst case scenario when thinking about what pes would do
11/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: Those who are registered
11/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 78297 70134: 99% of the time you end up being righ
11/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: Coz those who don't will not get the scholarship to begin with
11/02/2023, 6:37 pm - +91 94839 91979: <Media omitted>
11/02/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 78297 70134: yes but if everyone registers and they take top 15% of all students (including unregistered), there's a chance nobody gets the scholarship and pes gets all the registration money
11/02/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 78297 70134: I doubt they'll pass that chance up
11/02/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 78923 96437: <Media omitted>
11/02/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 90320 33391: Yeah! 💯 it's PES you can expect the unexpected!!
11/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 94839 91979: Wait pessat people don't have to pay extra?
11/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 99014 37680: we're already paying 4 L
11/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 99014 37680: what more do you want us to pay?
11/02/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 96057 85091: Wasn't it 4.5 or something
11/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 98801 93913: 4.1
11/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 97404 62509: 4.1L
11/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 99014 37680: My batch is 3.5
11/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 97404 62509: Fuck that 10k is for the scholarship😂
11/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 73532 91375: it's 4.5 for the upcoming batch
11/02/2023, 7:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Mine was 3.2 lol
11/02/2023, 7:13 pm - +91 99014 37680: lmao
11/02/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 94839 91979: True though, lmao
11/02/2023, 7:16 pm - +91 97395 33665: Isn't it the next 15%?? Or top 15%??
11/02/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 73532 91375: it's top 15%

11/02/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: @919901437680
11/02/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: Bro if we get like 60% isn't it 7 GPA
11/02/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: Also, do they give u your exact percentage or just grades and GPA?
11/02/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 94839 91979: Grades and gpa
11/02/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 94839 91979: To calculate percentage gpa-0.75×10
11/02/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 97395 33665: 6.75 gpa is 60%
11/02/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 94839 91979: So 7.75 gpa is 70 %
11/02/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 6360 508 139: if 60% then 6.75
11/02/2023, 10:01 pm - +91 94839 91979: It's weird but yeah even if you get 60 % actually ur gpa will be 7 and hence your percentage which will be shown will be 62.5
11/02/2023, 10:01 pm - +91 94839 91979: I think
11/02/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 97418 00513: Also how's maths 2
11/02/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 94495 71975: what kind of stuff were these guys on while coming up with the grading system
11/02/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 97418 00513: When compared to maths 1
11/02/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 82968 80555: Mdm
11/02/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 99015 54602: but according to this formula to get 100% we must get 10.75 cgpa how is it possible?
11/02/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 98451 84874: Yes
11/02/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 94495 71975: you arent supposed to reverse engineer the gpa from percentage i think 🤣
11/02/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 99723 09732: Math 2 is easier than math 1. Our math 1 paper was tougher than math 2
11/02/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: What's there in maths 2?
11/02/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 82968 80555: More failure
11/02/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: Also to study maths are pesuacademy notes good?
11/02/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 73532 91375: easy concept= tough paper, tough concept= easy paper ah?

11/02/2023, 10:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Math 2 is generally easier, but the papers tend to be on the same level
11/02/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ok bro 🙇🏻‍♂️
11/02/2023, 10:37 pm - +91 99014 37680: just grades and GPA
11/02/2023, 10:37 pm - +91 99014 37680: depends on teacher

12/02/2023, 9:52 am - Aditeya Baral: Which in turn causes issues when you have computer architecture
12/02/2023, 9:52 am - Aditeya Baral: Which again causes issues in OS

12/02/2023, 12:34 pm - +91 80882 73401: for x^4 use available forms
12/02/2023, 12:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: But the equation has weird roots
12/02/2023, 12:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: That's the problem
12/02/2023, 12:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: The roots are
12/02/2023, 12:36 pm - +91 94839 91979: It has i inside a root and all
12/02/2023, 12:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: Exactly
12/02/2023, 12:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: What value to sub for D

12/02/2023, 12:37 pm - +91 94839 91979: So it'll be the root of what you sent
12/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 90190 39181: i think its a wongstian eq
12/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 94839 91979: Hmm yeah i guess I'll try that
12/02/2023, 12:39 pm - +91 80882 73401: there is a situation where you need to find square root of a complex number that itself is a lengthy problem
12/02/2023, 12:39 pm - +91 80882 73401: if it is -4 in f(D) then something could be done there
12/02/2023, 12:40 pm - +91 94839 91979: Exactly
12/02/2023, 12:40 pm - +91 80882 73401: i mean in much easier way

12/02/2023, 6:23 pm - +91 97317 42338: I'm hoping for B grade bruh

12/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 94495 71975: most likely u have alr passed from ur isas , assignments and stuff ig

12/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: Assignment will they give full?
12/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 94839 91979: You have to pass esa also to have an overall pass i think
12/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 94839 91979: If you fail esa and your isa gets you to pass i don't think it's counted
12/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 94839 91979: According to what they told
12/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 90197 96534: I meant that everyone is gonna do so bad that even if ur just present in esa u will get a b grade

12/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 90197 96534: It was a joke lol
12/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 97317 42338: Probably not, our math teacher said for each assignment she'll give minimum 6/10, idk how good your teachers are
12/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: Are we relatively graded or what
12/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 94495 71975: during our cet batch orientation the guy told , u write esa just to improve ur score , as long as u attempt it should be fine , but if u skip , then its a direct fail
12/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 97317 42338: Oh nice, now I'm happy
12/02/2023, 6:28 pm - +91 94495 71975: wait from some senior to confirm lmao , cause the ppl say a lot of shit during speeches , dont do shit later
12/02/2023, 6:28 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ohh really? They told what i told in Friday :'), in that case it's peace

12/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 94495 71975: you thought wrong
12/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 97317 42338: I mean they have made 24 credits max so you can literally not write any esa and you'll pass
12/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: I don't get it
12/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: We can flunk ESA and pass?
12/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 94839 91979: You can get through 1st year by flunking one whole sem
12/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 73532 91375: Exactly 
No way pes gonna let us do that🙂
12/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 97317 42338: Basically, but it's not good to do so, it's like taking a huge loan you can't repay
12/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: What if I flunk maths 1 but get good in maths 2.
12/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: How
12/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 97317 42338: Later on you'll need to make up for the lost credits, and you may not be able to even if you try your best
12/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: So if i get 0 in ESA
12/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 97317 42338: Is how I understood it
12/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: I need to basically get 90 in sem 2
12/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: To go to sem 3
12/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Right
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - Aditeya Baral: It does
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: No
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: You'll go to sem 3
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: But you'll have failed math 1
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: You'll have to complete it again in 3rd sem
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: Or it'll be like you never learnt all those
12/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: There'll be no proof
12/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ah, idk man they told the other thing on friday
12/02/2023, 6:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: As someone said, it's theoretically possible to give only ISAs + assignment/project and pass the course
12/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 85005 76730: <Media omitted>
12/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 85005 76730: <Media omitted>
12/02/2023, 6:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: Since this adds up to 50 overall. And 30-something is pass
12/02/2023, 6:34 pm - Aditeya Baral: But you need to atleast show up for the ESA for that to happen
12/02/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 97317 42338: Yeah if you've gotten full marks in all right ? The minimum marks is 50 I think, or was it 40?
12/02/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: 40
12/02/2023, 6:34 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you don't show up for ESA they'll mark you as failed
12/02/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 94839 91979: I needed the first sub question friend :)
12/02/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 94839 91979: But thanks
12/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 85005 76730: I will send it
12/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 97317 42338: Is this from the sample paper? That arbitrary functions question?
12/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Wokays brother
12/02/2023, 6:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: One part of it is
12/02/2023, 6:35 pm - Aditeya Baral: And if you do fail the course, then you'll still go to the next semester and so on. You'll need to sit for the course again the next time it happens (a year later) or give the exam in the summer. In both options, you'll have to *only give the ESA out of 100*.
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: So ISA marks become null?
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeap
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you fail the course, and give it as a backlog exam
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: What if we don't write the backlog
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: Then you don't get degree
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: And you are ineligible for placements
12/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: We don't get the credit no
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - +91 97418 00513: We can get extra credits from elsewhere na
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: No, because you've enrolled for that course during registration.
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - +91 94495 71975: well for that u had to withdraw from exam while doing esa registration
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also, most courses like math are mandatory
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - +91 97418 00513: Oh
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: Once you register, you *have* to pass it
12/02/2023, 6:37 pm - +91 97418 00513: Realistically. How many here think they gonna fail?
12/02/2023, 6:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: From my experience, it's very very very unlikely anyone fails
12/02/2023, 6:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: The combination of ISA+ESA+assignments will pass you
12/02/2023, 6:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you've done decently in ISAs, and assignment, you should be passing already
12/02/2023, 6:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or close to the passmark
12/02/2023, 6:38 pm - +91 97418 00513: 17 in ISA
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: Assignment 5
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: And if you get even like 50 in ESA, that will make you pass
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: And written assignment hopefully 5
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: That's already 27
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: What about 30ish
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: In ESA
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: You're telling me you can't get 20 marks in the ESA?
12/02/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: Lol worst case
12/02/2023, 6:40 pm - Aditeya Baral: Lmao see, everyone passes. It's very rare to see someone fail
12/02/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 94495 71975: bro u rewrite the qn u get 15 marks for 15 qns as a given condition 💀
12/02/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 97418 00513: Mhmm
12/02/2023, 6:40 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah dw about passing here. Passing here is almost guaranteed
12/02/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fr 1 mark for attempting?
12/02/2023, 6:41 pm - Aditeya Baral: You're very unlikely to fail unless you leave a blank paper in ESA
12/02/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 85005 76730: <Media omitted>
12/02/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 78297 70134: challenge accepted
12/02/2023, 6:41 pm - Aditeya Baral: ESAs are difficult but failing is a very unlikely option. Just focus on giving it your best
12/02/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ahh i did the same mistake at first, shouldn't it be fx and not f' and fy? So fx and fy don't get cancelled
12/02/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 94839 91979: I dont think it's solvable....

12/02/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97395 33665: It should be (1-x)

12/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 80739 73180: no there's no way 5 is in the denominator
12/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 80739 73180: it has to be multiples of 2
12/02/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 73532 91375: exactly
12/02/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 97395 33665: Bro wrong formula
12/02/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 97395 33665: Use
12/02/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 97395 33665: X^(m-1)/(1+x)^m+n
12/02/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 97395 33665: Should work then
12/02/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 94839 91979: For that the limit should be 0 to infinity i think
12/02/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 80739 73180: but the limits are 0 to infinity for that form
12/02/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 73532 91375: it's 1-x in the formula no?
12/02/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 97395 33665: Yeah. Should be
12/02/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 80739 73180: no there's one more form of beta function where the limits are 0 to infinity

12/02/2023, 11:04 pm - +91 94495 71975: alr , lemme try
12/02/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 94495 71975: cone formula has a pi in it , the solutions doesnt , so its a different formula , but idk which one 😂

13/02/2023, 8:59 am - +91 6361 790 234: because there's no constant term to attack with ai and -ai
13/02/2023, 8:59 am - +91 97418 00513: And alpha is a normal one right
13/02/2023, 8:59 am - +91 6361 790 234: attach*
13/02/2023, 8:59 am - +91 6361 790 234: see
13/02/2023, 8:59 am - +91 97418 00513: Oh so alpha can be treated like a number
13/02/2023, 9:00 am - +91 97418 00513: And a like x or y
13/02/2023, 9:00 am - +91 6361 790 234: you write as alpha+beta(I)
13/02/2023, 9:00 am - +91 6361 790 234: nono, a is a constant and so are alpha and beta
13/02/2023, 9:00 am - +91 97418 00513: Mhmm
13/02/2023, 9:01 am - +91 6361 790 234: see alpha and beta depend on what you get as roots 

so naturally if the roots are constant, they are too
13/02/2023, 9:03 am - +91 97418 00513: Ohh alright

13/02/2023, 12:36 pm - +91 97395 33665: How did you get m²+1+1??
13/02/2023, 12:36 pm - +91 88846 11078: i don't think we have cases for imaginary roots in partial diff eq
13/02/2023, 12:36 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro we replace dy by 1 na??
13/02/2023, 12:37 pm - +91 97395 33665: Yeah but we also replace DX/dy with m. Not DX²/dy
13/02/2023, 12:37 pm - +91 90080 58527: That was in the other unit ig no?
13/02/2023, 12:37 pm - +91 90080 58527: Here it's like we take D/D' as m in the auxiliary
13/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 6363 426 538: Those are non homogeneous diff equations which are not in syllabus
13/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 90080 58527: It's not homogenous that eqn
13/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 76187 12509: Like dz/dx = m so, d2z/dx2 = m^2?
13/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 90199 42460: Yeah this question is Lil out of syllabus
13/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 90199 42460: Only PI we can find
13/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 90199 42460: CF we don't know
13/02/2023, 12:39 pm - +91 98451 92789: in PDE CF of imaginary roots is not given
13/02/2023, 12:40 pm - +91 76187 12509: Exactly
13/02/2023, 12:40 pm - +91 90320 33391: Yeah! Imaginary roots condition is not given
13/02/2023, 12:41 pm - +91 98451 92789: but in auxiliary eqn D/D' is taken as m
13/02/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro our teacher taught us that Dx should be replaced by m and Dy by 1...

13/02/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 90320 33391: It's the same thing! Just dividing by Dy
13/02/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 76187 12509: Oh😅

13/02/2023, 1:17 pm - +91 76187 12509: How do we simplify it?
13/02/2023, 1:17 pm - +91 94495 71975: you have to sit and derive it from the main gamma eqn , or just remember the value 🫠
13/02/2023, 1:21 pm - +91 78927 60478: Ooohhhh

13/02/2023, 2:43 pm - +91 79756 56645: should we derive and show?
13/02/2023, 2:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: What if it's x^n + (1+ x^m)?
13/02/2023, 2:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: In this case
13/02/2023, 2:44 pm - +91 90320 33391: Then I guess, some other substitution should be taken
13/02/2023, 2:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yeah @917975656645 got a formula  for that?
13/02/2023, 2:45 pm - +91 90320 33391: If it's for 6M or 7M I guess we should
13/02/2023, 2:45 pm - +91 79756 56645: that only I was searching
13/02/2023, 2:45 pm - +91 79756 56645: ohh ok
13/02/2023, 2:46 pm - +91 90320 33391: But still is the question isn't done, we have to express it in terms of gamma, so using beta-gamma relation it done.
13/02/2023, 2:46 pm - +91 90320 33391: Its*
13/02/2023, 2:46 pm - +91 97418 00513: What's T(3/4)?
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 79756 56645: the gamma m * gamma n/ gamma m+n one right?
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: And T(1/4)
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 90320 33391: Yeah!
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 78922 40050: It's gamma 3/4 only
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 78922 40050: We can't simply further
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: No value eh?
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 78922 40050: T3/4*T1/4 value is there
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 79756 56645: if its given as gamma 1/4 * gamma 3/4 we can
13/02/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: T3/4* T3/2 i need

13/02/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 79756 56645: if u cant simplify it further leave it at that point only
13/02/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 97418 00513: I'm using yor formula for first part of sum no. 5
13/02/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 90320 33391: If you read the question, then asked to express this expression in terms of gamma.
13/02/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 90320 33391: They*
13/02/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 79756 56645: i just sent the first part
13/02/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 78922 40050: T3/2 is (√π)/2
13/02/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 97418 00513: And 3/4
13/02/2023, 2:50 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ye a that's what I need actually
13/02/2023, 2:50 pm - +91 97418 00513: I could convert BETA to gamma tho lol
13/02/2023, 2:50 pm - +91 73377 17868: 3/4 leave it as it is it can only be simplified when 1/4 is there using pie/sin n pie

13/02/2023, 4:51 pm - +91 79750 80168: Solution is wrong  volume should be 8xyz  u are taking x y z as the side lengths but x y z represents the points on the parallelepiped and not the side lengths. The condition is specific to the points.
13/02/2023, 4:51 pm - +91 94839 91979: Isn't a rectangular parralellopiped a cuboid?
13/02/2023, 4:52 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah

13/02/2023, 4:59 pm - +91 81054 57532: But it contains 8
13/02/2023, 4:59 pm - +91 6361 236 715: exactly....it has to be xyz

13/02/2023, 5:01 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro but that's a straight up assumption
13/02/2023, 5:01 pm - +91 90199 42460: Even in your assumption...all you've done is taken product of side lengths
13/02/2023, 5:01 pm - +91 90199 42460: I've done the same, but assumed sides are x,y and z

13/02/2023, 5:03 pm - +91 79750 80168: U can't assume the sides as x y z tho because x y z is already reserved for the points based on the condition
13/02/2023, 5:03 pm - +91 79750 80168: The condition already assumes x y z are points
13/02/2023, 5:04 pm - +91 90199 42460: Makes sense

13/02/2023, 5:25 pm - +91 94839 91979: According to equation given, the ellipsoid has its centre at Origin, consider a point x,y,z since it is a rectangular parralellopiped, it's same as cuboid, so the sides will be 2x,2y,2z and volume will be 8xyz
13/02/2023, 5:26 pm - +91 94839 91979: 2x,2y,2z because if the point is in first octant due to symmetry the other vertex will be in the second octant and it'll be 2x distance

13/02/2023, 8:33 pm - +91 79756 56645: Dx/P=dy/Q=dz/R and do solve with multipliers
13/02/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 77188 25988: Can you like...show it on your notebook if possible?

13/02/2023, 8:52 pm - +91 90368 07007: The second set of multipliers shud be different... 
I'm figuring it out

13/02/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 97395 33665: You can put multiples of the same multiplier
13/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 97395 33665: Use the recursive functions to write the answer in J0 and J1.

13/02/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 98862 00525: Multiples of the same multiplier shouldn't be used

You should use independant ones

13/02/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 6361 836 808: ??

13/02/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 88846 11078: you can group first and second, and solve it as reducible to exact differential form
13/02/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 88846 11078: Mdx and Ndy would be homogenous so you can use 1/Mx+Ny for the I.F.
13/02/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 73532 91375: It's not Mdx one 
It's for Lagrange multipliers
13/02/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 99454 47761: Try differentiating both sides by x.
13/02/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 6361 836 808: We tried it
13/02/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 77188 25988: Ok thanks
13/02/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 97395 33665: What if you solve its as a quadratic equation and then integrate
13/02/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 88846 11078: you just need to solve it no, it doesn't have to be with multipliers
13/02/2023, 9:23 pm - +91 96638 05552: We still haven't got the seating arrangement right??

14/02/2023, 1:38 am - +91 91130 10981: lmao i gave up
14/02/2023, 1:39 am - +91 97395 33665: there are no options. so if that question comes you aint got no choice
14/02/2023, 1:39 am - +91 91130 10981: Proof for 9th one won't come recurrence derivations aren't there
14/02/2023, 1:39 am - +91 90366 74925: 8th one idk nd dont even wanna know , 0-x integration💀
14/02/2023, 1:40 am - +91 91130 10981: 8th one just differentiate both sides and use property 1 of recurrence relations
14/02/2023, 1:40 am - +91 90366 74925: u sure ?
14/02/2023, 1:40 am - +91 89042 32230: i don't think that it'll come tho.
14/02/2023, 1:40 am - +91 91130 10981: Yeah our math teacher told us
14/02/2023, 1:40 am - +91 97395 33665: lets hope so

14/02/2023, 11:06 am - +91 94495 71975: I would suggest just to ask invigilator for such doubts , it's our first time writing, they can't ignore such qns

14/02/2023, 11:21 am - Aditeya Baral: And you can bubble using any pen. I've used blue pens throughout engineering
14/02/2023, 11:22 am - Aditeya Baral: Although yes if the invigilator makes a fuss about it then carry a black pen for backup
14/02/2023, 11:30 am - +91 97418 00513: We can wear whatever no

14/02/2023, 4:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: See if you think about it, it's gonna get scanned into a b/w copy. Even if you use a rainbow coloured pen itll show up as black or grey.

Just use either blue or black. Doesn't matter which one you use for which purpose.
14/02/2023, 4:40 pm - +91 94495 71975: So rainbow coloured it is then

14/02/2023, 9:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: For our batch and before the default password for everyone on most online access portals was "pesit". So unless someone explicitly changed it (which rarely people did), you can use any PRN and pesit as password for most things
14/02/2023, 9:40 pm - Aditeya Baral: 2018 batch definitely works, just tried it with a random PRN and it logged in

15/02/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: Can someone explain
15/02/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: How's it 2
15/02/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 77188 25988: Why would you FORWARD birthday wishes...??
15/02/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 97395 33665: 0,1,2
15/02/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 94495 71975: cause indexing starts from 0
15/02/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 97395 33665: So basically index is 2
15/02/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: It's index(5) no
15/02/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 97395 33665: Its the index of 5
15/02/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 94495 71975: index of the number 5
15/02/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ohhhh lmao
15/02/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: I thought index of the list
15/02/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 6362 204 078: it will give only the first index of the element even though there are duplicate elements in the same list
15/02/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 77188 25988: Gives the first index of 5
15/02/2023, 8:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
15/02/2023, 8:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: What?
15/02/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: What is temp
15/02/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 94495 71975: temp is s.pop ,2nd line
15/02/2023, 8:31 pm - +91 94495 42890: It's a variable that has the value of 'marks' thing
15/02/2023, 8:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ohh
15/02/2023, 8:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: So it stores the values of the popped keys?
15/02/2023, 8:32 pm - +91 94495 42890: Exactly
15/02/2023, 8:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: What if multiple keys are popped
15/02/2023, 8:32 pm - +91 94495 42890: I think u can't cuz pop takes only one argument or smth
15/02/2023, 8:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: What if i use pop twice
15/02/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 6364 096 999: You'll need a second variable to store the second pop ?
15/02/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 94495 42890: Yeah u can do that 
I was saying that you can't put multiple keys inside the same pop function
15/02/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Like in this case s.pop('name')
s pop('marks')
Print(temp)
15/02/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ohh ok
15/02/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Gotcha
15/02/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Didn't see temp was a variable lol i thought it was a pre defined keyword 😭
15/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: Makes sense
15/02/2023, 8:46 pm - +91 90197 96534: It returns the first occurence of the element
15/02/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 72040 58969: Do any of you know where the previous years' question papers for python are?
15/02/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 73532 91375: 1. Better PES
2. PES Media(discord server)
3. Library website
15/02/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 72040 58969: Where exactly on the library website is it?
15/02/2023, 10:15 pm - +91 72040 58969: I couldn't find it on Better PES either
15/02/2023, 10:27 pm - +91 90368 07007: ..

15/02/2023, 11:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: I just created an object
15/02/2023, 11:28 pm - +91 74836 11935: class bank():
    acn="456987"
    def _init_(self,name,address,actype):

15/02/2023, 11:28 pm - +91 74836 11935: I thought of just this
15/02/2023, 11:28 pm - +91 94495 71975: I created an object and then called the variables+fns associated with it as well
15/02/2023, 11:29 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ye sane

16/02/2023, 7:28 am - +91 97390 95035: I think you can
16/02/2023, 8:05 am - +91 74835 33581: Which is the library website

16/02/2023, 11:39 am - +91 90086 35374: K
16/02/2023, 12:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: Don't mug lol. Know what each transformation does and implement the same in your own function. Example - filter returns an element only if the condition is true, so return only the elements satisfying the condition
16/02/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 94495 42890: Bruh that's well and Good if they ask output related questions for reduce and all
But what if they ask to write the entire program? 
Then...?
16/02/2023, 12:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Same logic right? Not that the way map works will change
16/02/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 6366 682 139: what is there? just make the function and use some example input
16/02/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 94495 42890: bruh i just cant seem to remember the logic for all these things

16/02/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 6366 682 139: i was exactly writing a similar program
16/02/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 6366 682 139: how will you add elements to the end of a list??
16/02/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 6363 529 889: Can anyone send previous year q papers??
16/02/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 6366 682 139: answer this
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 82965 44577: ig need to define two functions use append and pop and keep a maximum limit
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 94495 42890: l.append()
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 79756 56645: append
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 6366 682 139: exactly
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 6366 682 139: no how will you remove stuff from end of list??
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: This message was deleted
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: Pop
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 80734 96504: pop
16/02/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: By default it removes from end of list
16/02/2023, 12:29 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yes
16/02/2023, 12:29 pm - +91 6366 682 139: now use these functions to implement the logic
16/02/2023, 12:29 pm - +91 6366 682 139: by checking conditions
16/02/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 6366 682 139: the condtions given are that:
you can add only if length of list is less than 10

you can remove only if length of list is above 0
16/02/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 76187 12509: k bro thx

16/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 6366 682 139: so i just gave hints on how to solve
16/02/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 94495 71975: thats why i sent the code after u explained

16/02/2023, 2:37 pm - +91 6366 682 139: just multiply each digit with powers of 12
16/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 6366 682 139: and add
16/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 6366 682 139: same for base 23
16/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 89054 72730: But did they teach us this shit in our classes?

16/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 6366 682 139: no but we can solve it by taking hex system as example
16/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 89054 72730: Okok
16/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 77602 37280: Not for other bases only for 16&8 base

16/02/2023, 3:13 pm - +91 94495 71975: OR logical operation ig
16/02/2023, 3:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: So how is 5|7|5
16/02/2023, 3:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: = 7
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 82965 44577: wait isnt it used for union of two sets?
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 94495 71975: it compares each binary digit of the number with OR
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 98867 39499: No its there
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 97395 33665: Write them in binary and solve you will get 5
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 97395 33665: 7
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 97395 33665: *
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: Okay gotcha
16/02/2023, 3:14 pm - +91 94495 71975: yeah OR operation means union of sets only , different terms in different fields (AND is intersection)
16/02/2023, 3:21 pm - +91 91481 77956: Is this answer supposed written in if block
16/02/2023, 3:25 pm - +91 80733 72459: <Media omitted>
16/02/2023, 3:25 pm - +91 90197 96534: Will the output be true/false or something m

16/02/2023, 3:26 pm - +91 91481 77956: No it's some variable
16/02/2023, 3:26 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ok

16/02/2023, 3:27 pm - +91 90197 96534: Very noob question ik
16/02/2023, 3:27 pm - +91 91481 77956: That line is just a part of a program where num exist
16/02/2023, 3:27 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ohh
16/02/2023, 3:27 pm - +91 80733 72459: The question is just write a logical expression
16/02/2023, 3:27 pm - +91 90197 96534: Rigt
16/02/2023, 3:27 pm - +91 90197 96534: My bad

he didn't give us marks or anything for it
16/02/2023, 6:04 pm - +91 80734 96504: is the secret of our energy
16/02/2023, 6:04 pm - +91 85537 17575: No idea, maybe they wanted to give some more marks
16/02/2023, 6:05 pm - +91 74069 53442: probably wanted to raise the average
16/02/2023, 6:05 pm - +91 85537 17575: They may have fucked something up in the back end

16/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 77602 37280: Replace 1 with 0 and 0 with 1
16/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 80734 96504: convert to binary and replace 0 and 1
16/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 77602 37280: Do it 3 times
16/02/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: What
16/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 77602 37280: Then convert it to decimal

16/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 77602 37280: Yeah in this case it's enough
16/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: What's the final answer
16/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: 5 in binary is 101??
16/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 73532 91375: -12
16/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 97418 00513: How
16/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 94495 71975: short cut for one complement is 
~x = -(x+1)
apply 3 times and then multiply
16/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 73377 17868: ~n =-(n+1)
16/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 97418 00513: Didn't understand
16/02/2023, 6:28 pm - +91 78928 44424: How many marks is considered from ISA for the grades?

16/02/2023, 6:28 pm - +91 97418 00513: 50
16/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: Including assignment
16/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 73377 17868: ~3 =-(3+1)=-4 do it two more times
16/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: It's 5 no
16/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: ~5
16/02/2023, 6:29 pm - +91 94495 71975: ~x =-(x+1)  - formula , remeber it
~~(~5) = ~ ~(-6)
~ ~(-6 )= ~5
~5 = -6
-6*2 = -12
16/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 79756 56645: answer is -12
16/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 73377 17868: Just an example with random number do the same .
16/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 94495 71975: its not negation operator 
its one's complement operator

16/02/2023, 6:36 pm - +91 78928 44424: Say, I did not do well in a particular ESA but performed will in the ISAs and assignments of that subject.

16/02/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 94495 71975: in 3rd line try something like 
x[i]= str(i) maybe?
16/02/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 94483 00569: Didn't change the list
16/02/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 6366 682 139: noe
16/02/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 78297 70134: huh ok I'll try something else
16/02/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 6366 682 139: i is just a temp placeholder for the list values
16/02/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 6366 682 139: try this
16/02/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 6366 682 139: for i in range(len(x)):
    x[i] = str(x[i])
16/02/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 82965 44577: why len?
16/02/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 90086 35374: Can anyone send the program of all units

16/02/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 83107 58397: The typecasted i is local only to that for loop
16/02/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 78297 70134: I see
16/02/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 78297 70134: so it was changing the i in line 3
16/02/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 78297 70134: and not the elements in line 1
16/02/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 94834 59419: a = [4,7,3,7,'c']
for i in range(len(a)):
    a[i] = str(a[i])
print(a)
@917829770134 here's the shorter version
16/02/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 83107 58397: yeah
16/02/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 93537 16080: a=[str(i) for i in a]
16/02/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 78297 70134: ty

16/02/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 94495 71975: the no error part isnt shown
16/02/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 78922 40050: only 5 right?
16/02/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 79756 56645: ohh
16/02/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 72040 36083: Is an iterable, can be nested
16/02/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 78922 40050: u wont get any error
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 90197 96534: If it's finally instead of else then it will print no error also
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Once you return it won't go ahead
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 79756 56645: i didn't read it as else
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 79750 80168: It will just give 5.0 ryt??
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 79756 56645: my bad
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 79756 56645: ya bro my bad i read the question wrong
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 6362 844 543: There is a return statement so it immediately comes out of the function
16/02/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 79750 80168: Ah fine fine
16/02/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 94495 71975: ah makes sense
16/02/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 94495 71975: if there was print statement it would continues and even the else part would execute ryt ?
16/02/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Yuppp
16/02/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 6361 236 715: are v allowed to type all programs, outputs and all on screen instead of writing on paper tmr ?
16/02/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 82968 80555: Yep
16/02/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: Try writing
16/02/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: Typing is a pain in the ass, especially with the keyboards in PES
16/02/2023, 9:26 pm - +91 90086 35374: Hmm

16/02/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 90190 39181: G capital
16/02/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 90190 39181: lesser ascii
16/02/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: Exactly
16/02/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 6362 844 543: But that's not the condition
16/02/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: They can't cut for indentation while writing
16/02/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 77953 89834: Better to type yeah..

16/02/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: Writing they can't

16/02/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro the condition given is a true or false....it doesn't work for min func
16/02/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Finally is executed regardless of what happens
So it's executing after every try or except
16/02/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Then it should throw me an error right? Why is it not an error?
16/02/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 90199 42460: I have no idea
16/02/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 98867 39499: And none?
16/02/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Oh that's cuz you are returning nothing
16/02/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 98867 39499: Ohkay
16/02/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 90199 42460: When you print a function with no return value, it returns None by default
16/02/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 98867 39499: Got it👍
16/02/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 90086 35374: Can anyone send difference between final block and except block
16/02/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 90086 35374: Is this concept there for our syllabus
16/02/2023, 9:34 pm - +91 94839 91979: It's min function idk how it works for key true or false, but it's not used for what you want, use filter instead
16/02/2023, 9:34 pm - +91 90199 42460: Finally gets executed no matter what...except is executed only when error is encountered
16/02/2023, 9:34 pm - Aditeya Baral: Bold of you to assume such things xD
16/02/2023, 9:34 pm - +91 90086 35374: Any three points please
16/02/2023, 9:34 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Fair enough, it's just weird so😂
16/02/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 85537 17575: Else gets executed if there is no error
16/02/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Not much da
16/02/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: How will they
16/02/2023, 9:35 pm - Aditeya Baral: Only one way to find out
16/02/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 90199 42460: I don't think there's 3 points😂
16/02/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 79756 56645: they will cut marks for not identing properly
16/02/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 6362 844 543: It depends on the teacher ig😂😂if they are in a good mood then they will give marks else nope💀
16/02/2023, 9:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: Don't assume things not in your control
16/02/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yeah but margin for error is more while writing
16/02/2023, 9:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: PES corrections aren't known for being lenient, or strict for that matter. You get what you deserve, so pick the safe option and type out code
16/02/2023, 9:38 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Okay i understood this now. If it's false it gives 0 and green is the first false answer so that's the min
16/02/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 6361 236 715: Bruh ig python typing is way better than writing
16/02/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 6361 236 715: Actually 😂🤦🏻
16/02/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 97395 33665: Depends on your kpm
16/02/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 99014 37680: They usually tell that they need proper grammar and logic
they will ignore a few mistakes like a typo or something

16/02/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 97395 33665: This doesn't work. Its just that none of the starting letters are same
16/02/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 97395 33665: So you are a getting output
16/02/2023, 10:28 pm - +91 83103 70225: Any barch student,dm me

17/02/2023, 8:34 am - +91 97418 00513: Let's say we have lambda x : x^2, range (5)
17/02/2023, 8:34 am - +91 98884 33389: It represents XOR
17/02/2023, 8:35 am - +91 97418 00513: Didn't understand
17/02/2023, 8:36 am - +91 98884 33389: XOR is a logical operation which gives 1 if only one of the input is 1
17/02/2023, 8:36 am - +91 97418 00513: M hmm
17/02/2023, 8:36 am - +91 97418 00513: So for range 5
17/02/2023, 8:36 am - +91 97418 00513: We'll have 1^2 2^2 3^2 and 4^3
17/02/2023, 8:37 am - +91 97418 00513: 4^2*
17/02/2023, 8:37 am - +91 86600 64191: Will give 1 if only odd number of 1
17/02/2023, 8:38 am - +91 98884 33389: No man, I think you need to convert those in binary form and evaluate the logical operation
17/02/2023, 8:38 am - +91 97418 00513: Still don't get it
17/02/2023, 8:38 am - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>

17/02/2023, 8:42 am - +91 88846 11078: should be 2, 3, 0, 1, 6
17/02/2023, 8:42 am - +91 88846 11078: convert both the number in the range and 2 to binary and evaluate bitwise with XOR
17/02/2023, 8:43 am - +91 88846 11078: like 001 XOR 010 would be 011

19/02/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro convert the delta which has 3  15 ohm resistors
19/02/2023, 2:39 pm - +91 90199 42460: Then use mesh analysis
19/02/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 82965 44577: by doing that each resistor will go in series or parallel with 20ohm resistors?
19/02/2023, 2:52 pm - +91 95350 42904: Parallel because current splits at that junction
19/02/2023, 3:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: This ain't epd no?

19/02/2023, 4:41 pm - +91 89054 72730: asked*
19/02/2023, 4:41 pm - +91 94495 71975: cause u need to find the new saturation current at 40C
19/02/2023, 4:42 pm - +91 94495 71975: using Is(t2) = Is(t1). 2^(t2-t1/10)
19/02/2023, 4:42 pm - +91 89054 72730: ohh okok
19/02/2023, 4:43 pm - +91 94495 71975: or they are just trying to be nice and gave it for 7 marks 😂
19/02/2023, 4:43 pm - +91 89054 72730: I thought Is is same for all conditions[]

19/02/2023, 4:45 pm - +91 94495 71975: for fwd bias yes , but for reverse bias , there is temp variation for Is
19/02/2023, 4:45 pm - +91 89054 72730: Is should be changed no?
19/02/2023, 4:45 pm - +91 73532 91375: Y?
19/02/2023, 4:46 pm - +91 73532 91375: Only temperature and Vd are changed....
19/02/2023, 4:46 pm - +91 94495 71975: saturation current is affected by temp changes
19/02/2023, 4:46 pm - +91 73532 91375: Oh..

19/02/2023, 11:36 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro like the middle resistor and right side one are in parallel whose combination is in series with the other 3k resistance, this is how I did😅
19/02/2023, 11:37 pm - +91 80734 96504: no no middle one is in series with other one and both of them are parallel to a 3k resistance
19/02/2023, 11:38 pm - +91 94839 91979: This is right
19/02/2023, 11:38 pm - +91 76187 12509: Ohh

19/02/2023, 11:41 pm - +91 76187 12509: 1.5 + 3 we get 4.5 bro net resistance
19/02/2023, 11:41 pm - +91 97395 33665: 1.5 from where??
19/02/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 76187 12509: 3×3/3+3, if 3 and 3 are in parallel
19/02/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 97395 33665: Ohh 3 and 3 aren't in parallel if I am not wrong
19/02/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 76187 12509: Yeah I did that wrong
19/02/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 97395 33665: Ohh its fine ig

voltage VD=0.68 V if the Reverse Saturation is 5 x 10-12 A at a temp of 270
 C. (Consider 
η=1). Find the new thermal voltage and reverse saturation current at 320C can anyone solve this
20/02/2023, 5:43 pm - +91 90086 35374: Hmm

20/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 97317 42338: Just a question, if we go through past year papers and study questions/concepts repeated multiple times, can we expect those same concepts to show up this year as well? Or does PES change things a lot?
20/02/2023, 6:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: The syllabus changes every year, don't use that strategy to learn concepts. First year does not change much, but there are good changes every year to the syllabus from 2nd year onwards
20/02/2023, 6:38 pm - +91 97317 42338: Then I honestly dk how I'll do 5 units of physics plus lab records in one day

20/02/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 84314 78734: Sorry left is harward because data and memory are separate
20/02/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 94839 91979: No right is Harvard because there's multiple channels, left is Von Neumann it has only one channel

20/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 90197 96534: Idc is there in notes
20/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: Vdc
20/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: Not idc
20/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 73532 91375: use same formula for Idc too
20/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 73532 91375: Idc= Im sinwt
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: Yes
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 98451 92789: so v derive Vdc and write similarly for Idc, does that work
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: No
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: Do idc directly
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ig
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 97418 00513: Just replace vdc with idc and v RMS with i RMS?
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 73532 91375: yes
20/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 94495 71975: and vm with im as well i think
20/02/2023, 7:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ah scene is that bad huh F
20/02/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 89054 72730: Nahh just write Im= Vm/RL+Rf
20/02/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 90197 96534: Yes
20/02/2023, 7:30 pm - +91 90197 96534: I was saying don't do this
20/02/2023, 7:33 pm - +91 90197 96534: Wait it's idc only
20/02/2023, 7:34 pm - +91 90197 96534: <Media omitted>
20/02/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 94834 59419: And for Irms?

20/02/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 72900 58727: Is it not just Vrms/R
20/02/2023, 7:53 pm - +91 94495 71975: what is rf 💀, i thought it was only divided by rL
20/02/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 90197 96534: Diode resistance
20/02/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 72900 58727: Resistance by forward biased diode
20/02/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 94495 71975: ah
20/02/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 6363 228 627: In shockley's equation if  there is a change in temperature Vd remains the same, and only Is changes right?
20/02/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 80736 35736: VD decreases by 2.5 mv
20/02/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 76187 12509: 2.5 thing is knee voltage right
20/02/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 90197 96534: I thought only breakdown voltage decreases?
20/02/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 90197 96534: And knee voltage
20/02/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 97395 33665: Bread down voltage doesn't. Only knee voltage does
20/02/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ok
20/02/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 90197 96534: Thx

21/02/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 82965 44577: Because lab questions are only being asked from this sem
21/02/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 94495 71975: because at that time lab exam used to be a thing
21/02/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 94495 71975: they doing every random experiment with our batch itself 🫡
21/02/2023, 8:23 pm - +91 97395 33665: Till last year they were 1 credit course
21/02/2023, 8:25 pm - +91 96320 07839: BRO TF!?
CHEM WAS 1 CREDIT!?!
21/02/2023, 8:25 pm - +91 82870 36683: No the lab

XD
21/02/2023, 8:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: We had separate lab exams and theory exams
21/02/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 89054 72730: Do we have any idea what they’ll ask for lab?
21/02/2023, 8:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: The labs we're separate courses only
21/02/2023, 8:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: So we had regular lab tests, quizzes, etc for lab as well
21/02/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 82965 44577: Only formula related stuff
21/02/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 96320 07839: ohh.. i see..
21/02/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 82965 44577: Ig
21/02/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 89054 72730: Even we had quizzes
21/02/2023, 8:28 pm - Aditeya Baral: You guys have a lab manual right? Our lab exams were strictly based on that only, so go through that
21/02/2023, 8:33 pm - +91 73532 91375: yes, we do have them
21/02/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 90197 96534: Even now chem lab is 1 credit
21/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: Wait
21/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: I can't see it in my courses tho
21/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: Is chem lab a separate one credit course?
21/02/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: So r the total no of credits 22 or 23?
21/02/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 6363 529 889: Anyone has Answer keys to the q papers?
21/02/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 89054 72730: 22
21/02/2023, 8:45 pm - +91 97395 33665: It isnt
21/02/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 93292 42883: Wait so the lab manual 250 marks thing will be included in this Chem only?
21/02/2023, 9:22 pm - +91 90197 96534: It would seem so
21/02/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 6363 529 889: Ig your project marks is that only cause i dont recall doing any project in chemistry
21/02/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 90197 96534: The report is the project ig
21/02/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 90197 96534: The waste water sample thing
21/02/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 6363 529 889: Oh yeah
21/02/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 88846 11078: it's 8 marks from the lab record+2 marks from the report

22/02/2023, 9:31 am - +91 97418 00513: Unit 5
22/02/2023, 9:31 am - +91 97418 00513: 4*
22/02/2023, 9:32 am - +91 90086 35374: Unit 4
22/02/2023, 9:32 am - +91 90086 35374: Last concept
22/02/2023, 9:33 am - +91 97418 00513: Determination of corrosion rate?
22/02/2023, 9:33 am - +91 97418 00513: Or anodic protection
22/02/2023, 9:34 am - +91 97418 00513: Coz it's not there in the slides
22/02/2023, 9:37 am - +91 93532 54650: It is not there in the syllabus.
22/02/2023, 9:37 am - +91 97418 00513: Cool
22/02/2023, 9:40 am - +91 6363 529 889: <Media omitted>
22/02/2023, 9:43 am - +91 97418 00513: Over here see qn 1 a
22/02/2023, 9:43 am - +91 97418 00513: Phase diagram is from unit 2
22/02/2023, 9:43 am - +91 97418 00513: Then why in qn 1
22/02/2023, 10:04 am - +91 94495 71975: Syllabus changes quite frequently in PES, especially che from what our che sir said  , so there will be discrepancy in pyqs sometimes
22/02/2023, 10:27 am - Aditeya Baral: Don't depend 100% on papers - standard rule in PES
22/02/2023, 10:27 am - Aditeya Baral: Syllabus changes, topics get shifted around etc
22/02/2023, 10:27 am - Aditeya Baral: See the papers only to know the type of questions usually asked from a unit
22/02/2023, 10:28 am - +91 97418 00513: They don't mix units no
22/02/2023, 10:28 am - +91 97418 00513: Like 1 qn has 100% qns from the same unit
22/02/2023, 10:28 am - Aditeya Baral: Yup that's always guaranteed
22/02/2023, 10:28 am - +91 97418 00513: Haan peace
22/02/2023, 10:28 am - Aditeya Baral: But it's possible that a topic which was in unit 1 in let's say 2018 can be moved to unit 2 in 2019
22/02/2023, 10:29 am - Aditeya Baral: That's why if you see previous papers you'll find these issues like topics being mixed
22/02/2023, 10:29 am - Aditeya Baral: Ideally, use the papers only to find out whether a unit has more theoretical stuff asked or numerical/conceptual
22/02/2023, 10:29 am - Aditeya Baral: First year it barely changes. Once you enter your branch you'll see sometimes the entire unit has been replaced lmao
22/02/2023, 10:48 am - +91 6363 529 889: Anyone?

22/02/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: yo
22/02/2023, 12:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: Why the difference
22/02/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: Between "final ISA" and "your score"
22/02/2023, 1:42 pm - +91 89054 72730: Where are you seeing this
22/02/2023, 1:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: Pesu academy app
22/02/2023, 1:43 pm - +91 89054 72730: Where in that
22/02/2023, 1:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: See isa results
22/02/2023, 1:44 pm - +91 97418 00513: And then tap on the three bars in the final isa column
22/02/2023, 1:46 pm - +91 89054 72730: Can’t find it in my device
22/02/2023, 1:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: Huh
22/02/2023, 1:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
22/02/2023, 1:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: Tap this
22/02/2023, 1:59 pm - +91 89054 72730: must not be updated in my system then because it's not showing final isa score yet in the app
22/02/2023, 2:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Probably one of them includes the assignment/project
22/02/2023, 2:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: Check the website
22/02/2023, 3:38 pm - +91 97418 00513: Can someone tell me the experiments
22/02/2023, 3:38 pm - +91 97418 00513: Specifically for unit 1 4 5
22/02/2023, 3:39 pm - +91 73532 91375: pva exp, edta exp, waste water exp and colorimetry
22/02/2023, 3:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: Thanks
22/02/2023, 3:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: We don't have types of LED right
22/02/2023, 3:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: Since we didn't for ISA
22/02/2023, 3:46 pm - +91 73532 91375: not sure of that tbh, we might get coz it's *esa*
22/02/2023, 3:52 pm - +91 97418 00513: That's only 5
22/02/2023, 3:52 pm - +91 97418 00513: 4*
22/02/2023, 3:52 pm - +91 97418 00513: We gotta have 6 no?
22/02/2023, 3:53 pm - +91 73532 91375: 10 r there, all 10 exp will come
22/02/2023, 3:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: But which ones from unit 1 4 5
22/02/2023, 3:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: Name all 6 of these
22/02/2023, 3:54 pm - +91 73532 91375: wait
22/02/2023, 3:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: Which
22/02/2023, 4:00 pm - +91 73532 91375: unit-1= colorimetry, nanoparticles
unit-4= pva, phase diagram exp
unit-5= chemical oxygen demand, hardness of water
22/02/2023, 4:05 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Dear All

Students can come to the F Block ground floor class rooms for  sessional signing ( tabulation of your ISA marks along with the assignment and Lab/project marks) after your exams at 4.00 pm today (22.02.2022).

We have made a check of all the entries.

In case you still feel that there is a variation in the marks you may put a circle around the marks for that particular  ONLY with a PENCIL.
Such cases will be verified once again with the marks at the COE office before they are finalized and taken for grading.

The verification for the sections are arranged in the following class rooms
F101 - Sections M, N, O, P
F103 - Sections Q, R, S and T.
F104 - Sections U, V,  and W.
22/02/2023, 4:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: Hello
22/02/2023, 4:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: What about us

22/02/2023, 4:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: Mhm
22/02/2023, 4:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: So if i feel I've gotten less somewhere
22/02/2023, 4:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: I can circle that?
22/02/2023, 4:09 pm - +91 73532 91375: <Media omitted>
22/02/2023, 4:10 pm - +91 73532 91375: yes u can
22/02/2023, 4:10 pm - +91 91082 65521: Unit 5 do LED do we have ?
22/02/2023, 4:10 pm - +91 91082 65521: That OLED
22/02/2023, 4:10 pm - +91 97418 00513: Doubt
22/02/2023, 4:10 pm - +91 91082 65521: Yes or no 
Don't say doubt n all
22/02/2023, 4:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: Aye
22/02/2023, 4:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: If I ain't sure what am I supposed to do? Raise my arms up and sing the national anthem?
22/02/2023, 4:11 pm - +91 73532 91375: yes do it
22/02/2023, 4:12 pm - +91 99456 67559: OLED yes, types of led no
22/02/2023, 4:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: If I end up giving you the wrong answer you'll come sit on my door
22/02/2023, 4:13 pm - +91 94834 59419: This group should be renamed to "chem cycle doubts" tbh
22/02/2023, 4:14 pm - +91 94834 59419: Anyways does anyone have all units numericals? (Chem cycle)
22/02/2023, 4:14 pm - +91 94495 71975: 💀
22/02/2023, 4:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: Makes me wonder if physics cycle students are smart. Or we are dumb. Or both. Or maybe P cycle is ezzz
22/02/2023, 4:19 pm - +91 73532 91375: we will get to know if P cycle is easy or not in next sem 😃
22/02/2023, 4:20 pm - +91 97418 00513: Lmao imma study hard bro
22/02/2023, 4:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: For the first isa
22/02/2023, 4:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Then back to my old ways
22/02/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 88612 61394: This message was deleted
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yes yes
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: If you die
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Theoretically
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 89042 32230: 😞
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: They'll shit the college for  2 days
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: So if you wanna
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 89042 32230: You have been studying too much.
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Not that I'm asking you to
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 88612 61394: Bro if i jump from building i fly up according to the phy i wrote
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 89042 32230: reduce the numbers
22/02/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Even though I'd be grateful
22/02/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: Kill yourself in the college
22/02/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 89042 32230: 👨‍🔬 i plan to create a new compound in chem paper tomorrow
22/02/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: And I'll swallow it
22/02/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 72900 58727: Just one? Rookie numbers
22/02/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 89042 32230: 🤝
22/02/2023, 4:33 pm - +91 89042 32230: 😞
22/02/2023, 4:36 pm - +91 78297 70134: Thank god we don't have a lab exam
22/02/2023, 5:53 pm - +91 96057 85091: A new compound can be produced in the human bdoy too
22/02/2023, 5:58 pm - +91 6363 975 192: Bro , Do we have to read from Chemistry lab manuals for exam?
22/02/2023, 6:00 pm - +91 80739 73180: yes
22/02/2023, 6:00 pm - +91 80734 96504: It would seem so
22/02/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 89054 72730: <Media omitted>
22/02/2023, 6:28 pm - +91 80734 96504: Reserve battery
22/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 90197 96534: Where is it given?
22/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 94495 71975: <Media omitted>
22/02/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 90086 35374: I think we don't have deep about it only we have what is reserve batteries and example
22/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 89054 72730: Yeah that's why we don't have anodic cathodic reactions in that
22/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 90086 35374: Hmm
22/02/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 90086 35374: C/w = ESD
22/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 90086 35374: C=wnf/m×3600
22/02/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 94495 71975: gotcha , thanks
22/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 90086 35374: It's my pleasure
22/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 89054 72730: they asked esd not ed
22/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 94495 71975: yeah lmao , i realised that now
22/02/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 90086 35374: Ya
22/02/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 80734 96504: Not in syllabus
22/02/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 97317 42338: How did the physics exam go today? 💀💀
22/02/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 73376 22626: question out of bounds *invalid*
22/02/2023, 7:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Eh dw too much, physics is always a bad scene for most. Atleast the worst of physics cycle is over now
22/02/2023, 7:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Math and physics are bad almost always for everyone. Electrical depends on whether you like solving those kind of problems. Rest of the courses usually go easy
22/02/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: So basically
22/02/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: Chem cycle mfs are fucked now
22/02/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 79756 56645: I didn't answer in exam. I won't answer here
22/02/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: And fucked even harder the next sem
22/02/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 72040 36083: Hey, anyone enrolled for this?
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97317 42338: This message was deleted
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 72040 36083: What tf should we fill in roll number in the form, srn, prn, usn Or fucking class roll number, which one is it?
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yo @919686041205
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: How's c when compared to python
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 73532 91375: P sure it's srn
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97317 42338: It's tuff
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 73532 91375: C is more worse
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fr???
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 94495 71975: c is harder
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 79756 56645: Bro chem is easier than phy da
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97317 42338: Much much worse, its like going from automatic to gear vehicle
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 97418 00513: I thought it was supposed to be easier to learn
22/02/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 72040 36083: Okk
22/02/2023, 7:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: Again depends on person to person. People with a stronger programming background usually don't face difficulties. People who had python as their first language are in for a hard time
22/02/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fucking hell
22/02/2023, 7:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: How long would it take for an average biology Joe to learn C?
22/02/2023, 7:08 pm - +91 97317 42338: Chill bro one more esa then a week of holidays, then the usual starts again
22/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 96063 43985: Less than a week on your own time of you're a good learner
22/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 97418 00513: And that's 10 hrs a day
22/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 97418 00513: To learn within a week
22/02/2023, 7:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Depends on how well you adapted to Python
22/02/2023, 7:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Honestly once you learn one language it becomes progressively easier
22/02/2023, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Concepts remain usually the same, logic needs to be built by you
22/02/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: Uh huh
22/02/2023, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Syntax is the only thing that differs. Takes usually a week to pickup the basics of syntax for a new language
22/02/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: Python i scored bad but understood like an avg person
22/02/2023, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: So even though you might have just learnt python, it'll _might_ be better for C
22/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: Mhmm gotcha
22/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: N how's p cycle
22/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: Like electrical and mechanical r theory right
22/02/2023, 7:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Dw about it. There are a lot of people who come into college with 0 programming background. That doesn't mean you all are doomed or that people who know languages are superior. Everyone starts on step 1, people take their step 1 at different stages in life.
22/02/2023, 7:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: Thanks a lot man
22/02/2023, 7:13 pm - +91 82968 80555: Electrical ain't theory g
22/02/2023, 7:13 pm - +91 82968 80555: It's completely solving
22/02/2023, 7:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Considerably harder for most compared to chem cycle
22/02/2023, 7:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: Physics is very different from your usual 11/12th syllabus so people find it difficult. Math is again difficult, mechanical is all theory, electrical depends on whether you like solving
22/02/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: Wait so mechanical is theory?
22/02/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: I like solving easy stuff
22/02/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: Also, how's maths 2 compared to 1
22/02/2023, 7:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: Almost 98% of it was theory for my batch
22/02/2023, 7:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: Maths 2 is a little easier concept wise but the papers are still difficult lmao
22/02/2023, 7:16 pm - +91 97418 00513: Integrals?
22/02/2023, 7:21 pm - +91 97390 95035: @919686041205 doing god's work
22/02/2023, 7:21 pm - +91 90199 42460: Should be harder
22/02/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 80884 07523: thats what she said
22/02/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fr fr
22/02/2023, 7:23 pm - +91 73532 91375: why is Kevlar stronger than steel? what's the answer for this?
22/02/2023, 7:24 pm - +91 94495 71975: inter molecular hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking
22/02/2023, 7:25 pm - +91 73532 91375: thanks
22/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 96112 55845: can one of you please send mechanical slides pdf if u have them?
22/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 94495 71975: in the formula for capacity , w is the weight of battery or active material alone ?

24/02/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97395 33665: bold of you to assume we listened to the lectures in class
24/02/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 76187 12509: Da 🤣
24/02/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 76187 12509: Like A/12 is in portion but that uses integration so.....

24/02/2023, 8:11 pm - +91 80734 96504: For derivations u need integration
24/02/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 94495 71975: actually thats an oversight , since we dont have a/11 , and a/12 is derived from a/11 , so it cant be there 
but yes there are other integration based problems and derivations as well
24/02/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 94495 71975: so either study too hard or just leave 1 possible qn that might come from integration based concept lol
24/02/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 76187 12509: Shud we read theory from tb itself or does anyone have a pdf??

28/02/2023, 5:53 pm - +91 78297 70134: the declaration's pretty sus ngl
28/02/2023, 5:54 pm - +91 88846 11078: little too much focus on personal problems
28/02/2023, 5:57 pm - +91 94495 71975: basically they dont give a fuck abt ur personal problems , keep studying and score marks 😃👍
28/02/2023, 5:57 pm - +91 94495 71975: well atleast thats what the wording of the declaration feels like
28/02/2023, 5:57 pm - +91 94984 76291: Not a pes moment unless they force students to come on the first day 👍🏼
28/02/2023, 5:59 pm - +91 78297 70134: yeah but like
28/02/2023, 5:59 pm - +91 78297 70134: what they call personal problems is very poorly defined
28/02/2023, 6:00 pm - +91 94495 71975: yep quite vague tbh
28/02/2023, 6:00 pm - +91 82968 80555: I wonder why counselor exists
28/02/2023, 6:00 pm - +91 78297 70134: some kid's parent might go and complain that how Pes does things is extremely stressful for the students and pes might go "that's a personal problem 😃👍"
28/02/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 78297 70134: also this thing isn't titled "student monitoring guidelines"
28/02/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 78297 70134: so they might be referencing something else  entirely
28/02/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 73532 91375: Everything is a personal problem here
28/02/2023, 6:02 pm - +91 73532 91375: <Media omitted>
28/02/2023, 6:27 pm - +91 88846 11078: very pes-like to make us sign a form referencing a secret third thing

28/02/2023, 7:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup
28/02/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 82968 80555: Also extremely bad timing but like I need some hope,does pes have college trips 💀

28/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 99723 09732: Barely any, never heard of them. Though.... The PES MUN Society does go to outstation MUNs, that's the closest to a college trip ig
28/02/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Ye he's called VBS

28/02/2023, 7:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Closest to a "trip" is if you go to another university for some contest
28/02/2023, 7:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not just MUNSoc, other clubs as well. But you really can't call them trips lol
28/02/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 90083 45926: Just curious about why would you want a college trip  💀 especially when it's organised by pes
28/02/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 90083 45926: I'd rather them give a holiday
28/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lol idt they would be fun also
28/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 90197 96534: 1000 people going to the same place
28/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 90197 96534: That*
28/02/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 90197 96534: It's better to plan a trip on ur own
28/02/2023, 7:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: See, PES isn't going to do anything fun for you all so there is no point expecting things
28/02/2023, 7:13 pm - +91 82968 80555: "Real education for the Real world" fr
28/02/2023, 7:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: What education
28/02/2023, 7:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: Come third year and you'll realise what a big scam it is because you're so unprepared for placement tests and interviews because college didn't teach you anything
28/02/2023, 7:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: Just to set expectations clear - the only thing you'll get is your degree, which will qualify you for future opportunities for jobs or higher education. Don't expect anything else out of this place. If you want anything, you're going to have to create the opportunity yourself
28/02/2023, 7:16 pm - +91 91087 96229: <Media omitted>

28/02/2023, 7:18 pm - +91 91087 96229: Does pes have any measurable CP or Robotics or any deep tech culture at all?
28/02/2023, 7:19 pm - +91 91087 96229: Like in higher sems
28/02/2023, 7:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: CP? Not really. Everyone here rides the ML hype train without knowing what it is. A few years ago we used to do okayish at ICPC but lately in the last 2-3 years I barely see any teams even trying
28/02/2023, 7:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: GSoC, I know one person from 2023 batch, and another from 2021 batch
28/02/2023, 7:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Robotics I'm not sure since I'm not into that field so I don't keep track
28/02/2023, 7:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: The club culture in general is plagued with issues because of a shit move they pulled a few years ago, but it is what it is unfortunately :(
28/02/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 99014 37680: what shit move??
28/02/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 6361 631 974: What'd they do
28/02/2023, 7:23 pm - +91 6361 631 974: <Media omitted>
28/02/2023, 7:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Aren't you the batch in which they introduced verticals
28/02/2023, 7:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Wait are you 2024 batch
28/02/2023, 7:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or 2025
28/02/2023, 7:24 pm - +91 99014 37680: 2025
28/02/2023, 7:24 pm - Aditeya Baral: Regardless, PES used to have a good number of tech clubs. All of these used to be student driven, had a bunch of activities and most importantly had very minimum teacher involvement thus guaranteeing a lot of freedom to handle things
28/02/2023, 7:25 pm - Aditeya Baral: But somewhere around 2 years ago, PES pulled a move in which they basically officially declared most of these existing clubs (some which have been there for 5+ years) as "unofficial" and introduced something called "CSE verticals" which were _teacher-run_ versions of the same clubs
28/02/2023, 7:25 pm - Aditeya Baral: They replaced like a small number of very good quality clubs with 50+ low quality clubs trying to push for involvement and complete control

28/02/2023, 7:26 pm - Aditeya Baral: As a result when the 2024 batch joined, they were under the idea that the existing old clubs are unofficial, and the participation reduced *drastically*. Some clubs just died out cause nobody joined :(
28/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 90199 42460: alright
28/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 90199 42460: not recommending PES to anyone anymore

28/02/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 80884 07523: Anything pes would do any sane person would do that opposite
28/02/2023, 7:26 pm - Aditeya Baral: And ironically, these very CSE verticals - half of them are dead now cause they barely do anything
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 99014 37680: lmao
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 99014 37680: PES Moment
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 80884 07523: Pretty much all colleges are at this level based on what I've heard
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: All because now, Shylaja is like the superior head of these clubs. Before the club head had full autonomy, not anymore
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: But this wasn't all
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: To completely wipe out the old clubs, they *cut off the funding*
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 73532 91375: Me
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lmfao u were going to recommend to people before u found out abt this?
28/02/2023, 7:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: Clubs without funding and participation cannot exist. As a result, most died in the last 2 years
28/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Why does this sound like the beginning of a villain arc
28/02/2023, 7:28 pm - Aditeya Baral: So now the club culture in general suffered
28/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 80734 96504: Common pes L
28/02/2023, 7:28 pm - Aditeya Baral: Never going to forgive PES for doing this to our clubs
28/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lmfao my guy is just severely making us regret joining here
28/02/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 73532 91375: Classic shylaja move

28/02/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 90199 42460: ahh....that's why the attachment
28/02/2023, 7:30 pm - Aditeya Baral: Soon became the largest development club on campus, bigger than every other club. We organised a nation wide hackathon with over 800+ participants
28/02/2023, 7:30 pm - Aditeya Baral: We even had an annual summer internship project where anyone could sign up and work with seniors on a project of their choice ~and we did not use CGPA and assessment tests to filter like PIL~
28/02/2023, 7:30 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup
28/02/2023, 7:31 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's still active in EC campus, since this vertical thing happened mainly in RR
28/02/2023, 7:31 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Damn
28/02/2023, 7:31 pm - Aditeya Baral: But RR is facing lots of issues
28/02/2023, 7:31 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Oh wtf 😂
28/02/2023, 7:31 pm - +91 73532 91375: Rr made a lot of issues*
28/02/2023, 7:31 pm - +91 6361 631 974: So EC campus doesn't have this drawback?
28/02/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 90199 42460: i joined the wrong campus
28/02/2023, 7:32 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not as much as RR
28/02/2023, 7:32 pm - Aditeya Baral: https://clubs.pes.edu/hackerspace
28/02/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 73532 91375: Get 9.5 cgpa and go to ec campus
28/02/2023, 7:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: Atleast my name stays on the official website 🥲
28/02/2023, 7:33 pm - +91 96320 07839: Ya no need for tat
Cause anyways they don't value ec campus🙂
28/02/2023, 7:33 pm - +91 96320 07839: So less cgpa also will work
:D
28/02/2023, 7:33 pm - +91 90197 96534: Which club is it lol?

28/02/2023, 7:40 pm - Aditeya Baral: EC campus also has one channel let me find
28/02/2023, 7:40 pm - +91 81056 35154: Because for conducting a contest it felt very weird that I am going to shylajas offices 100 times just for an online contest that also some 100 other drama she does
28/02/2023, 7:41 pm - +91 81056 35154: I thought anyone can conduct without any nuisance but there are rules and regulations also for this sed
28/02/2023, 7:42 pm - +91 86609 38836: Wait CGPA and assessment tests as a criteria for participation sounds scary 💀

28/02/2023, 7:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: Sinus huh

If you go to the Instagram page and scroll a little down, you'll find a bunch of posts with people's faces. They're called "HackerSpace Stories" and contain the story of how HackerSpace was born through the eyes of the core members. Mine is also there 👀

They're fun reads, take a look

03/03/2023, 6:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: The last 2(?) Batches have been affected by COVID delays so first years never got a summer break
03/03/2023, 6:40 pm - Aditeya Baral: Otherwise summer break is a pretty long period here

03/03/2023, 6:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: I mean it's almost. You usually also get almost a week in May since all ESAs tend to end by like 21st-25th
03/03/2023, 6:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's not accurately 2.5, but always comes to 2+ months and about 7-10 days

In which we gonna only waste our time
2weeks is better

03/03/2023, 9:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: There are either 2 or 3 subjects per week

06/03/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 94495 71975: I have no idea what you are talking abt 🥹
06/03/2023, 11:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you're stressing about your results, don't. It's just a single semester don't let it get into your head. You have like 5 more chances before your CGPA can't change anymore
06/03/2023, 11:54 pm - +91 94495 71975: But like isn't the first 2 semester the easier ones compared to the next 4?
06/03/2023, 11:55 pm - +91 90320 33391: I thought cgpa is avg of 8 sems' sgpa
06/03/2023, 11:55 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Got less than expected lmao
06/03/2023, 11:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: On the bright side you guys now know how much effort ISA/ESA takes and where you guys need to put more effort in. 

One pro(?) tip is that you absolutely _need_ to be consistent and also have good time management. If you do well in ISAs and assignment/lab/project, the dependency on ESA goes down giving you room to screw up. Never ever ignore these components.
06/03/2023, 11:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Usually they are, but exceptions exist. People do better over time because they learn from their mistakes
06/03/2023, 11:56 pm - +91 94495 71975: 🙏
Thanks for the wise words
06/03/2023, 11:56 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Mr. Wise sage giving us best advice
06/03/2023, 11:56 pm - +91 6361 631 974: 🙏
06/03/2023, 11:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Companies start coming from 7th sem (actually from 6th sem if you want a summer internship), so pretty much 5 more chances. Plus if you're targetting higher education it'll also be around the same time
06/03/2023, 11:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: A lot of people ignore the ISAs. Big mistake cause these actually do help a lot and you realise that during your ESA
06/03/2023, 11:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: In higher semesters you'll also have labs for almost every course + assignments and/or project. Maximising marks in these is the only way to ensure that you have room to screw up in ESA
06/03/2023, 11:59 pm - +91 90320 33391: 🙏🏼 thanks a ton for the advice
07/03/2023, 12:00 am - Aditeya Baral: ESA is reduced to 50% every semester. Which means if you lose 20 marks, you only lose 10. Now if you maximise the marks in the other 50 from ISA and other components, you have given yourself lot of cushion to fall back on if the exam doesn't go your way
07/03/2023, 12:00 am - Aditeya Baral: But yeah, don't stress it. Just use the first semester as a learning step
07/03/2023, 12:03 am - +91 91088 24105: What about backlogs
07/03/2023, 12:04 am - Aditeya Baral: What do you mean? If you have a backlog(s), then you'll need to pass the exam again. Either in summer when backlog exams are held or next year with the next batch. Your score for backlog will be counted directly out of 100 for the ESA you'll write again (whatever ISA and assignments/labs etc you gave will be void)

07/03/2023, 12:08 am - Aditeya Baral: Also guys, please don't drop into my DMs, leave a bunch of messages and then say "reply fast" if I don't respond immediately. 

I'm not a current student and I have work till evening on all days. Don't expect instant replies or poke me for a reply, I'll get back to your message when I get the time. I do try to respond to everyone who DMs in an acceptable time frame, but as far as possible either check reddit (cause a lot of questions are repeated) or have a little patience. Even I need some time beyond work to relax.
07/03/2023, 12:09 am - +91 95358 33858: For backlog esa they take only 50% .?or 100
07/03/2023, 12:09 am - +91 90069 45674: How much is considered a safe CGPA to sit for most (≈90%) company interviews by the 6th sem?

07/03/2023, 12:10 am - Aditeya Baral: 8.5

08/03/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 94495 71975: is it possible to learn this power 😳
08/03/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 73532 91375: Yes, just attend his classes 
U will get all power🥰
08/03/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: not from a jed-
08/03/2023, 9:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or just use WSL
08/03/2023, 9:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Or go full dual boot but understandable if people don't want to
08/03/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 79750 80168: Lmao true
08/03/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 74069 53442: Nah he's still the class incharge i think just doesn't teach chem
08/03/2023, 9:06 pm - Aditeya Baral: You guys will anyway have to use Linux at some stage or the other, might as well start getting used to it now
08/03/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 78297 70134: that's what our teacher recommended actually
08/03/2023, 9:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Makes sense, it's pretty easy to setup and on most newer Windows machines it comes pre-configured
08/03/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 91087 92419: He isn't our class teacher anymore
08/03/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 74069 53442: Enjoy then
08/03/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 91087 92419: Heh
08/03/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 94984 76291: Least based wsl user
08/03/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 77188 25988: Holy W
08/03/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I repeat, this guide follows the syllabus, and our teachers, especially Nithin sir, wants it to be done only in this way.

In addition, he wants us to install VirtualBox, run Ubuntu, download Sublime text in there and code there..
08/03/2023, 9:44 pm - Aditeya Baral: Why though
08/03/2023, 9:44 pm - Aditeya Baral: As long as you can compile the code it should be fine
08/03/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 94495 71975: our teacher told wsl tho
08/03/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 73389 36843: Step 1: install arch
Step 2: use vim
08/03/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Idk. Go ask him, he'll explain you in detail
08/03/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Not you too Icarus..
08/03/2023, 9:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah nobody's gonna check which OS you're compiling the code on
08/03/2023, 9:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: I have better things to do than visit PES and ask faculty members I have never met 😂
08/03/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Do you think I did that? I'm still running vs code and asserting dominance
08/03/2023, 9:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: VM or WSL, just make sure you use one of them for compiling. Either should be fine.
08/03/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But one look at my friends' faces and i was convinced to make the guide
08/03/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 6366 682 139: What are these?? I never heard of em. I'm using GCC
08/03/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 89054 72730: Sub system for linux
08/03/2023, 9:48 pm - Aditeya Baral: You can either install Ubuntu or any other distribution on a virtual machine and compile code there, or install WSL and compile code there. Both will use gcc, just that you'll have a Linux system to work with which makes things easier
08/03/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 90197 96534: This message was deleted
08/03/2023, 9:50 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But isn't running a virtual machine battery draining when you can just do it on windows with a file association??
08/03/2023, 9:50 pm - Aditeya Baral: MinGW used to have a few minor issues with Windows. Usually you won't come across them, but occassion some issue comes up. Most if not all end up using VBox or WSL at some point in the 2nd semester
08/03/2023, 9:50 pm - Aditeya Baral: Which is why WSL exists
08/03/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I really need to look it up.

Should I make a SilicoSheet about it too??
08/03/2023, 9:51 pm - Aditeya Baral: WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. It's like a Linux distribution installed into your Windows. I can't explain more in detail about how it works because even I don't have a very clear idea, but if you're looking for a Linux experience on Windows the closest is WSL.
08/03/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 96320 07839: **nvim
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yes nvim
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: You'll get all the advantages of your host machine - same RAM, CPU, GPU as well
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 83109 86426: Install kali😈😈
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Ahh I see
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 73389 36843: Kali only on VM please 🗿
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: Microsoft itself has a very clean documentation on how to set it up. If you're on Windows 11, it's already installed and just needs to be configured
08/03/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 83109 86426: There is a wsl version of kali right!!
08/03/2023, 9:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: There is
08/03/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 6366 682 139: There's soo much that I don't know... I feel left behind
08/03/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 73389 36843: I'd much rather use a VM for kali
08/03/2023, 9:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
08/03/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 94495 71975: Use the flare part of your username to motivate you to learn them all 🙏
08/03/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 73389 36843: But truth be told rather than Kali I'd prefer arch with blackarch repos enabled
08/03/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yep. Will surely do that.

Thanks!!
08/03/2023, 9:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: Its like a 10-15 min process if you follow this
08/03/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Is it like a VM or smth??
08/03/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Nvm will check it out myself
08/03/2023, 9:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: Try it out
08/03/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 6364 096 999: I spent a good 10 minutes to make vs code compile hello world now I have to do this instead huh 💀

08/03/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 82965 44577: can i just use this? 😂
08/03/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 73389 36843: Exactly
08/03/2023, 10:11 pm - +91 94495 71975: Online compilers aren't allowed, atleast that's what our teacher said
08/03/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 82968 80555: Guys for Chem cycle what's the best thing to study,slides or Sanket sir's notes?
08/03/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 90069 45674: Lata ma'am's notes if you can get em from someone
08/03/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 94499 22481: Sudheer sir's🫡 notes
08/03/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 82968 80555: Ayo he spoke about everything except the syllabus today🥶

08/03/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Just do combined slides properly, I'm pretty sure that's enough
08/03/2023, 10:24 pm - +91 83103 70225: Which subject is that?
08/03/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 73532 91375: He is still better than vbs😂
08/03/2023, 10:38 pm - +91 80736 35736: You are asking about epd ha ?
08/03/2023, 10:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: This teacher is not the clown he's the entire circus

09/03/2023, 4:44 pm - +91 73532 91375: Io takes place after the classes 
3.45-5.45
09/03/2023, 4:44 pm - +91 73532 91375: Not sure of attendance

Who all are joining for pesu io?
OPTION: Me (3 votes)
OPTION: Not me (79 votes)

09/03/2023, 7:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: Oh IO huh
09/03/2023, 7:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's a big hit or miss
09/03/2023, 7:29 pm - Aditeya Baral: Usually in 90% times they don't really help much and people drop out of the courses
09/03/2023, 7:30 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also the "experts" are like second years, sometimes third. Not exactly very qualified lmao
09/03/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: Why are so many people against I/O?
09/03/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: But certificates
09/03/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 81056 35154: not much value kekw
09/03/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 90366 74925: rakhke karega kya bhai 🤡
09/03/2023, 7:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: CV mei dalunga 🥲🤡
09/03/2023, 7:33 pm - +91 77953 89834: lol
09/03/2023, 7:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: Why does pesu have bad gateway now
09/03/2023, 7:35 pm - +91 96057 85091: Idk why but i heard this in his voice in my head
09/03/2023, 7:37 pm - +91 90086 35374: Oh k
09/03/2023, 7:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: Cause a lot of people find it useless
09/03/2023, 7:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: What will you do with these? Certificates don't matter at all if you don't have the skills for it
09/03/2023, 7:38 pm - +91 97418 00513: Uh huh
09/03/2023, 7:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: Certificates on resume don't matter if you don't have the skills to back then up tbh, either via projects or through experience
09/03/2023, 7:39 pm - +91 94839 91979: I think the io does give us that right? I mean the certificate certifies that you completed a project and attended the classes to gain knowledge?
09/03/2023, 7:40 pm - +91 99025 42502: Attended- yes
Gained knowledge- no
09/03/2023, 7:40 pm - +91 90366 74925: pretty much
09/03/2023, 7:41 pm - Aditeya Baral: Only attended, knowledge and project no
09/03/2023, 7:41 pm - +91 90366 74925: just an extension of clg classes basically
09/03/2023, 7:41 pm - +91 94839 91979: I mean every degree ever, unless you put in a little efforts yourself
09/03/2023, 7:42 pm - +91 94495 71975: a degree is 4y worth of studying compared to barely a month worth in io , so you will , even if you dont want to , earn a decent amt of knowledge in a degree
09/03/2023, 7:42 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ofc yes
09/03/2023, 7:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: The only way IO will help you is to _find_ out what exists out there. Don't expect to learn much, if at all anything
09/03/2023, 7:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: It'll help you explore and find out different fields and give you like a base introduction to each
09/03/2023, 7:43 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah exactly, it's 1 month thing ig, you just need to know what it offers and apply based on that
09/03/2023, 7:44 pm - +91 80884 07523: It's also not very beginner friendly
09/03/2023, 7:44 pm - Aditeya Baral: The experts aren't qualified to teach anything in those fields, so don't depend on them. Besides it's all self learning - they don't actually teach. They only like show you what to do and how to go about it
09/03/2023, 7:47 pm - +91 99025 42502: This message was deleted
09/03/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 99025 42502: True. SMEs are knowledgeable in their fields and are helpful during and after the sessions. But they’ve taken years to learn that concept themselves. So, it’s tough for them to summarise it in a month such that you truly understand stuff
09/03/2023, 7:50 pm - Aditeya Baral: Uhm no. The "SME"s are you seniors, studying a year above you. Maybe 2. There is no "years" of learning here
09/03/2023, 7:50 pm - +91 99025 42502: I meant in the scenario that they’ve learnt it since high school
09/03/2023, 7:51 pm - +91 99025 42502: Through their own interest
09/03/2023, 7:51 pm - +91 73496 22201: when is the last date to register for io guys?
09/03/2023, 7:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: You're assuming a very idealistic scenario here. In almost all cases they're a bunch of 2nd and 3rd year kids trying earn a few bucks with minimum effort. I know this, I had signed up for 2 in my first year.
09/03/2023, 7:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: People in 2nd year definitely don't have the qualifications needed to actually teach in depth in any field for that matter. Basic things like languages are okay, anything beyond that doesn't make sense
09/03/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 6366 075 009: Yo can anyone send calender of events?
09/03/2023, 7:55 pm - +91 94839 91979: Tomorrow i guess
09/03/2023, 7:55 pm - +91 87622 50928: <Media omitted>
09/03/2023, 7:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Although I'm saying this, sign up and see what a field has to offer. You won't learn anything, but it'll help you explore and find out what you're interested in
09/03/2023, 7:56 pm - +91 80884 07523: 800 rupees
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Oh wait
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's that much now?
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Lmao then don't
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ignore this 😂
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: It used to be free for us
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - +91 87553 16048: What!
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah
09/03/2023, 7:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: People in my batch and next batch also used IO to like explore fields and eliminate things and find their interest
09/03/2023, 7:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: That's the only way IO helps
09/03/2023, 7:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you're paying 800 bucks for that then it's a scam
09/03/2023, 7:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: Should be for free
09/03/2023, 7:58 pm - +91 77188 25988: Nah got PTSD last sem
09/03/2023, 7:58 pm - +91 87553 16048: Lol

🔫
09/03/2023, 7:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: PES last best years were in like 2016
09/03/2023, 7:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Since then it's all been downhill

09/03/2023, 8:00 pm - +91 87553 16048: Oh,now it makes more sense
09/03/2023, 8:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: But he might get a second term

11/03/2023, 1:39 pm - +91 84315 27126: Troo

11/03/2023, 1:40 pm - +91 91087 96229: Nah Manipal anol they still have some half decent professors

11/03/2023, 1:40 pm - +91 91087 96229: Youtube videos can't provide authoritative knowledge
Good for crash course style learning tho
11/03/2023, 1:41 pm - +91 84315 27126: I came from Manipal bro, not sure about that chief 💀
11/03/2023, 1:42 pm - +91 84315 27126: I have a few friends there as well
11/03/2023, 1:42 pm - +91 84315 27126: Nothing special
11/03/2023, 1:49 pm - +91 91087 96229: Have u seen their rovers

11/03/2023, 1:50 pm - +91 91087 96229: Pes doesn't have filament for 3d printer
11/03/2023, 1:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: Wait who is trying to leave PES lmao

11/03/2023, 4:12 pm - +91 91087 96229: Imagine leaving Manipal for pes
11/03/2023, 4:15 pm - +91 84315 27126: Facilities in Manipal way better but ul get bored of that shit Inna week
11/03/2023, 4:15 pm - +91 84315 27126: And placement wise Manipal L

11/03/2023, 5:37 pm - +91 91087 96229: Placement if u r good u can easily get off campus
11/03/2023, 5:37 pm - +91 91087 96229: Ig the focus should be on improving ur competence
Good Placements are a side effect of ur competence not the other way around
11/03/2023, 5:38 pm - +91 91087 96229: And Manipal gives far better opportunities
Not that it should be used as an excuse to crib about pes
But lol leaving Manipal for pes tho
11/03/2023, 6:06 pm - +91 84315 27126: Brother ur thinking ideal case, for that matter if ur competent then u don't even need a college, u can just freelance, PES in terms of placement is way better than Manipal
11/03/2023, 6:06 pm - +91 84315 27126: Statistically speaking
11/03/2023, 6:06 pm - +91 84315 27126: U can pullup 10 examples of ur frnds but that won't change the fact that statistically PES is better at placements
11/03/2023, 6:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: I wouldn't say easily, since you're competing with pretty much everyone on a country wide scale compared to in campus placements where you're competing with people from your batch

But yes, if you have the skills to crack the test and interviews it's possible to get off campus. My first internship at Intel Research was off campus only
11/03/2023, 6:08 pm - +91 84315 27126: But in terms of overall development Manipal is just far superior

11/03/2023, 6:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: Either way, if you're in CS atleast, you *have to* prepare on your own to get placed, regardless of the field you are getting into. College teaches only at a very shallow surface level
11/03/2023, 6:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: I saw that 👀
11/03/2023, 6:09 pm - +91 84315 27126: Troo
11/03/2023, 6:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you don't do anything beyond the syllabus, you really won't get placed. You have to get competent at _atleast_ problem solving, if not any field at depth
11/03/2023, 6:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Getting a 9.5+ CGPA by studying the syllabus isn't going to help you way much during placements. It's always an observed pattern in CS atleast that's it's always the 8.5-9 CGPA kids with a lot of other domain work/skills who get placed before the batch toppers
11/03/2023, 6:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: But don't bother yourselves with these things now, they'll all fall into place when the right time comes along
11/03/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 81056 35154: Sir pes labs can't afford screw drivers , the students are advised to go the carpenters in gjbc for screw drivers.  Having good placements depends on  students but labs and facilities manipal has better than pes
11/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 91087 96229: lmao drilling machine
11/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 81056 35154: Yea drilling machine
11/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 82966 96682: biotech labs 🙏
11/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: How bad are they
11/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 82966 96682: you're better off doing dry lab than wet lab for your capstone
11/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 81056 35154: Let's say u go to a robotics lab in pes and all y see are computers with linux on it
11/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 91087 96229: screw driver also they werent giving coz we might break em
no idea how we a person going to an engineering college could be stupid enough to break a screwdriver
11/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 81056 35154: Dont forget they told they can't afford screw drivers
11/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: And strong 👀
11/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 82966 96682: so much money they're taking from us can't even improve the labs 😐
11/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: Lolz all the managements students be like 🥲👍🏿
11/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nahh gotta build a new med college to cure kidney mein heart attack waale patients

11/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 97418 00513: This fucking RR campus
11/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 91087 96229: EC campus better tbh
11/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 97418 00513: Is already over crowded
11/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 82966 96682: hospital
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: Wait a few years when they move engineering to RR campus only
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 96320 07839: Agreed
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 73532 91375: Its gonna be more crowded
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 73532 91375: I hope we graduate from pes by then
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 73532 91375: Don't have to deal with that shit
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: Lmao the Mars Rover report from PES starts with
"We must learn to manage our expectations..."
11/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: sir first of all u r at PES
U think u will be that lucky

11/03/2023, 6:46 pm - +91 91087 96229: tf r we supposed to do w that
11/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 91087 96229: the robot is literally smaller than a roomba

11/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: And a cash cow for cunts
11/03/2023, 6:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: Don't worry guys ~it only gets worse~

Then we asked which wifi they were on and realised everyone facing the issue was a hostel kid/trying to access it from within campus

As you may know, the Qforest club has been inactive for a while, but I believe it has a lot of potential to grow and be a vibrant community for all those interested in the exciting field of quantum computing. That is why I am reaching out to ask for your support in reviving this club.

We need a co-club head who is passionate about quantum computing and would like to join me in leading this club. We have conducted many events with IBM (eg, the IBM Qiskit meetup in India) and have had talks on the quantum world from distinguished Speakers, and I believe we can continue to do amazing things with your help.

Please let me know if you are interested in being a co-club head of the Qforest club. I would love to meet with you and discuss further.

26/03/2023, 12:37 pm - +91 91488 13616: It'll give the decimals then use while loop to iterate through digits
26/03/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 86600 64191: yea i tried that
26/03/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 86600 64191: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 86600 64191: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 86600 64191: but then the number automatically gets some digits in the end
26/03/2023, 12:39 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Uhhh...
26/03/2023, 12:39 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I'll try sumting
26/03/2023, 12:51 pm - +91 90199 42460: Try formatting the float?
26/03/2023, 12:51 pm - +91 90199 42460: Like %.2f or something
26/03/2023, 12:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: Doesn't help
26/03/2023, 12:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: It doesn't change what is stored in the variable
26/03/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 91087 96229: U could try to do it without modifying f
26/03/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 91087 96229: So instead of multiplying by 10 everything to shift the tenths place to units place
U can keep a power of 10 counter
26/03/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 77758 82781: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 91087 96229: And just make a copy and shift it then and there
26/03/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 91087 96229: Repeat this a fixed number of times
26/03/2023, 12:54 pm - +91 91087 96229: 200
26/03/2023, 12:54 pm - +91 77758 82781: how?
26/03/2023, 12:54 pm - +91 94495 42890: 200
26/03/2023, 12:54 pm - +91 91087 96229: Read the question properly
26/03/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 91087 96229: This won't help actually
26/03/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 94495 42890: num less than equal 10 goes false num greater than 50 goes true
26/03/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 94495 42890: So 200
26/03/2023, 12:56 pm - +91 77758 82781: ohh ...thanks
26/03/2023, 1:01 pm - +91 91488 13616: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 1:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: The question says float not double
And this may still have precision errors
26/03/2023, 1:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: It works for the specific case it may not work for all
26/03/2023, 1:03 pm - +91 91488 13616: Precision is upto 6 decimal here right ?
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: Bruh the question is too ambiguous
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91488 13616: Problem with float is the compiler is overflowing and giving wrong value
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: No it's not overflowing
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: It has precision issues
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: Even a double has precision issues
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: U can input it as a string
26/03/2023, 1:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: That is the only way to do it
26/03/2023, 1:05 pm - +91 91488 13616: I highly doubt this will come though it's not easy to handle precision
26/03/2023, 1:05 pm - +91 93537 16080: Yes this seems to be the only way
26/03/2023, 1:05 pm - +91 91087 96229: Sir it may not come in the exam

But irl doesn't have a syllabus
26/03/2023, 1:05 pm - +91 93537 16080: Nothing else I can think of
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 91087 96229: U have to input it as a string
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 91087 96229: Then parse it to make sure it's a valid floating point number
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 93537 16080: Then extract the digits using char operatikns
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 93537 16080: After the decimal point is reached
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 91087 96229: Then do the counting
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 93537 16080: Overall a tedious process
26/03/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 91087 96229: Bruh it's literally a 20 line program
26/03/2023, 1:07 pm - +91 91488 13616: or use modf ?
26/03/2023, 1:07 pm - +91 93537 16080: Lol with more comprehensive string functions it could be done in 4 or 5
26/03/2023, 1:08 pm - +91 91087 96229: That's retarded
It defeats the point of using a language like C
26/03/2023, 1:08 pm - +91 91087 96229: That's like going to the gym to lift weights and get strong
Then saying it could he automated by using machines
26/03/2023, 1:14 pm - +91 84315 27126: Has Sem 1 ESA re valuation been completed yet? Has anyone's marks been updated yet?
26/03/2023, 1:19 pm - +91 93537 16080: ```#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
        char b;
        int decimal=0;
        int count=0;
        while((b=getchar())!='\n'){

}
printf("%d",count);
}```
26/03/2023, 1:19 pm - +91 93537 16080: this works
26/03/2023, 1:19 pm - +91 93537 16080: for the decimal counting

26/03/2023, 1:25 pm - +91 89054 72730: why is this printing 3 as value of n
26/03/2023, 1:26 pm - +91 93537 16080: Because a is 2 characters and newline is 1
26/03/2023, 1:26 pm - +91 90199 42460: Because you've passed 2 characters as argument
26/03/2023, 1:26 pm - +91 90199 42460: And \n
26/03/2023, 1:26 pm - +91 89054 72730: Okay tnx

26/03/2023, 1:44 pm - +91 89054 72730: `printf("rama\rkri\rbh");
26/03/2023, 1:44 pm - +91 90199 42460: Why did you put the dec = (int)num - 48?
26/03/2023, 1:44 pm - +91 89054 72730: why the output is bhia
26/03/2023, 1:45 pm - +91 94839 91979: It converts character into ASCII, ASCII value of 0 is 48 so if you need '0' to convert into intger 0 you'll have to subtract 48
26/03/2023, 1:45 pm - +91 90199 42460: Ohh got it thanks
26/03/2023, 1:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: Someone send all the lab programs please

26/03/2023, 2:10 pm - +91 89054 72730: Even when I compiled the file the output is bhia
26/03/2023, 2:14 pm - +91 70194 70904: It's because Rama \r kri returns kria as it overwrites the first three characters with kri. When you operate on that using \r bh it overwrites only the first two characters becoming bhia
26/03/2023, 2:14 pm - +91 96320 07839: Even in mac it's bh only
26/03/2023, 2:15 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah
26/03/2023, 2:15 pm - +91 96320 07839: But like

26/03/2023, 2:16 pm - +91 94495 42890: yeah the answer is its os dependent as well as IDE dependent ig
26/03/2023, 2:17 pm - +91 94839 91979: Demn
26/03/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 96320 07839: I mean
Like even your IDE uses GCC only no

26/03/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 94495 42890: yes it does
26/03/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 96320 07839: Maybe GCC functions differently in different OS ig
26/03/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 96320 07839: Great.
26/03/2023, 2:20 pm - +91 94839 91979: I used make commands as well and still bh
26/03/2023, 2:24 pm - +91 93537 16080: clang also gives bh
26/03/2023, 2:25 pm - +91 99454 47761: Make isn't a compiler, it still uses whatever compiler you have installed. Considering you're on a Mac, it probably uses clang.
26/03/2023, 2:27 pm - +91 96320 07839: ya
macs use clang only

26/03/2023, 2:34 pm - +91 94495 71975: they wont give such ambiguous qns tbh
26/03/2023, 2:36 pm - +91 91791 66297: printf("\"mahabharatha\"");
26/03/2023, 2:36 pm - +91 91791 66297: what will be the output of the above?

26/03/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 91791 66297: what about the \
26/03/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 80882 73401: Won't the \come at the beginning and end
26/03/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 80882 73401: It is \mahabharatha\
26/03/2023, 2:39 pm - +91 93537 16080: "mahabharata"
26/03/2023, 2:39 pm - +91 96320 07839: "\"txt\""

this is the syntax used to print "txt" in C
26/03/2023, 2:39 pm - +91 93537 16080: Its the escape sequence
26/03/2023, 2:39 pm - +91 96320 07839: its an escape sequence used to print ``` " ```
26/03/2023, 2:40 pm - +91 93537 16080: It tells c to ignore the meaning of "
26/03/2023, 2:40 pm - +91 80882 73401: Oh ok
26/03/2023, 2:40 pm - +91 89054 72730: \"something\" is used to put something in inverted commas while printing

26/03/2023, 3:06 pm - +91 90199 42460: Yeah ik, but it's printing reverse order
26/03/2023, 3:11 pm - +91 86600 64191: im getting correct order itself ya

26/03/2023, 3:15 pm - +91 98459 47782: the order in which arguments to any function are evaluated is undefined so it'll probably be different on different machines
26/03/2023, 3:15 pm - +91 98459 47782: its not related specifically to printf

26/03/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 78922 40050: we are giving character as input but we want the ascii value as output which is an integer
26/03/2023, 6:32 pm - +91 89715 15696: Because you need int data type for ascii values
26/03/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ohh okay
26/03/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: If we wanted address we use %f then?
26/03/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 84315 99055: Cause u wanna print the ascii value of the character and not the character itself
26/03/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 6363 976 348: %p

26/03/2023, 6:38 pm - +91 94495 42890: how to explain that now
26/03/2023, 6:38 pm - +91 74069 53442: shouldn't it be int main()
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 93537 16080: because the else is for the second if
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 93537 16080: not necessary
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 93537 16080: just main is also fine
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 94495 42890: alr tried that not an issue at all it gives the same thing
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 6366 682 139: not specifying a return type gives a warning but still works
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 6366 682 139: the answer is Flase
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 6366 682 139: False

26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 93537 16080: dont get confused by indentation
26/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 93537 16080: the first if has no else condition
26/03/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 97418 00513: Getting no output
26/03/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yeah no output
26/03/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 94495 42890: could u pls explain
26/03/2023, 6:40 pm - +91 93537 16080: forget the indentation given there
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 93537 16080: and put brackets and see how it comes out
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 6366 682 139: the second if and the else are seen as one statement under the first if
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 97418 00513: Second
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 93537 16080: its if(){
if(){
}else{
}
}
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 6366 682 139: so if m is not greater than 0, they are not even executed
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 97418 00513: First if has an else condition
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 93537 16080: bruh
26/03/2023, 6:41 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nested if has no else condition
26/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 6366 682 139: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 93537 16080: well very evidently it doesnt as you verified with your output screenshot
26/03/2023, 6:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nested if has no else condition?
26/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 6366 682 139: it does have
26/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 94495 42890: but normally isnt false the answer??
26/03/2023, 6:43 pm - +91 6366 682 139: the outer if doesn't have else
26/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 6366 682 139: nope
26/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 93537 16080: bruh
26/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 94495 42890: okok gotcha
26/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 94495 42890: thnx
26/03/2023, 6:44 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: if you want it that way, put brackets for the first if
26/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: Wait
26/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: So indentation is issue here?
26/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: nope
26/03/2023, 6:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: indentation is causing ambiguity
26/03/2023, 6:46 pm - +91 6366 682 139: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:46 pm - +91 91087 96229: U can make the loop body branchless
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 96320 07839: Bro
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 96320 07839: Sir it's C😂
Not py
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fucking hell
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 6366 682 139: whats wrong?? easy ryt
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: Explain the working behind the eqn someone
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 96320 07839: 😂😂
26/03/2023, 6:47 pm - +91 6366 682 139: z++
OR
AND
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 93537 16080: my dude just write it
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 97418 00513: What's && do?
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 6366 682 139: AND
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 97418 00513: & is AND
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 93537 16080: bitwise and
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 6366 682 139: thats bitwise AND
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 93537 16080: are you trolling rn?
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 6366 682 139: && is logical AND
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 73532 91375: Its And operator
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 97418 00513: Huh? Idk the difference tbh
26/03/2023, 6:48 pm - +91 90199 42460: Short circuit logical
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bitwise operates on the bits bro
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 6366 682 139: i really see a reason to make an operators cheatsheet..
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 73532 91375: && is AND gate ka logical and 
& is just and
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 73532 91375: Plz do😆
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 90199 42460: Like 1010 & 1100 gives 1000
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 6366 682 139: & - Bitwise AND
&& - Logical AND
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 97418 00513: So && takes only 1 and 0?
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 97418 00513: Cuz logic
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 6366 682 139: no it takes integers
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 90199 42460: & does that
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 6366 682 139: then converts em to binary
26/03/2023, 6:49 pm - +91 6366 682 139: then does that
26/03/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 6366 682 139: the &
26/03/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 97418 00513: Okay explain wrt to the sums
26/03/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 6366 682 139: && takes two Boolean operands
26/03/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 97418 00513: Sum*
26/03/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 6366 682 139: x and y are 2 Boolean values
26/03/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 6366 682 139: and z too
26/03/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 6366 682 139: in c we dont have defined words for true and false
26/03/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 97418 00513: Let's say x is one
26/03/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 97418 00513: Y 0
26/03/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 97418 00513: And z 7
26/03/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 6366 682 139: so anything except 0 and null is true
26/03/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 6366 682 139: so 1 && 0 || 7
= 1 && 1
= 1
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 79756 56645: bro uk and truth table?
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 97418 00513: Both values 1 is 1
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 97418 00513: Rest is 0
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 6366 682 139: everything except 1 and 1 is 0
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 79756 56645: yes
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 79756 56645: thats all
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 6366 682 139: only 1 and 1 is 1
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 6366 682 139: same like multiplication
26/03/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 79756 56645: ya
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: So 1 &&1 || 6
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 6366 682 139: why 6
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: 0 | 7
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: Typo
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: Right?
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yeah
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 6366 682 139: at the end doesn't even matter
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 6366 682 139: all it wants is value of z
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: And then do 0 XOR 7
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 6366 682 139: not a, where the value is being stored
26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: In bits
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: why XOR??
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: Or*
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: it is a || not |
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yeah
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: So logical OR?
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yeah
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6360 374 242: It is logical not bitwise
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: increment forst
then AND
26/03/2023, 6:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: then OR
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: What's 0 | | 7?
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 6366 682 139: 1
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 6366 682 139: or in this case 7
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: Gotcha
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: For example
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 6366 682 139: no wait
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 6366 682 139: it is 1
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: We have 3 && 4 || 8
26/03/2023, 6:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: Then?
26/03/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 6366 682 139: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 6366 682 139: 1 && 1 || 1
26/03/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 6366 682 139: so answer is 1
26/03/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ohh wait
26/03/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 97418 00513: So for logical
26/03/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 6366 682 139: anything except 0 or null is true
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: N> 0 is taken 1
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: Else 0
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 6366 682 139: no -ve also true
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 6366 682 139: N!=0 is true
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: Ok so n != 0 is taken 1
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 6366 682 139: ik its weird but it is C
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yep
26/03/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: This is for logical
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 6362 844 543: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: For bitwise just convert to 8 bits
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: Then use normal application?
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yea I guess
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 94839 91979: If a is greater than b it prints a first then b, otherwise b first then a
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 6366 682 139: ternary operator
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: If first condition is true
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 94839 91979: Su the answer for this is 10 0
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: Then it's 2
26/03/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 97418 00513: Else 3
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro isn't this left to right?
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yes
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yeah my bad
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 6366 682 139: i corrected it later
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 6362 844 543: Yeaa but that's not happening
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 93537 16080: its and first then or
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 91087 96229: For counting digits after decimal point divisible by 3
It's completely branchless

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

    int num;
    int passed = 0;
    int res = 0;
    while((num=getchar())!='\n') {
        passed = passed | (num=='.');
        res+=(passed)&(((num-'0')%3)==0);
    }

    printf("%d\n", res);

    return 0;
}

```
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 6366 682 139: its NOT -> AND -> OR
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 91087 96229: The loop body is branchless*
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 6362 844 543: If the condition is false, it gives the right answer, but if true it gives... Well the same answe
26/03/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 91087 96229: I'm not at home
Can someone benchmark this program and check if it is actually faster than other programs
26/03/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 91087 96229: I didn't even run it it might have errors
But since I wrote it it should not have errors
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6366 682 139: it has errors
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 91087 96229: What error
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6366 682 139: num is int
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 91087 96229: Bruh
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6366 682 139: getchar gives char()
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 93537 16080: bruh
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 91087 96229: That doesn't matter
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 91087 96229: It doesn't matter
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 91087 96229: int is better
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 93537 16080: int and char is the same stuff in c
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yea word
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6366 682 139: works
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 90199 42460: It implicit converts
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 91087 96229: It compiles without warnings and errors
26/03/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6366 682 139: my bad i didn't know we had to give input, coz no message was displayed XD
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 6366 682 139: yeah
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 91087 96229: OK now someone benchmark it no plz
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 6366 682 139: idk whats that
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 6366 682 139: someone do it
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 91087 96229: Like run it a few million times and compare it to the runtime of other programs
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 91087 96229: Like other people's proframs
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 6366 682 139: uhh
26/03/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 6366 682 139: nvm i have an exam to study for tomo
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: Run it with max optimization
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: Lol
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: O3 flag
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 90199 42460: Should it be with && or only &
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 81056 35154: <Media omitted>
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: The program is correct
26/03/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: I had to use different in different places to remove if statements and ternary operators
26/03/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: Silico sir only u can do it
26/03/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 82968 80555: Is there a major difference between i++ and ++I?

26/03/2023, 7:47 pm - +91 85537 17575: Guys pls help
The question is: Check whether the given number is divisible by the sum of its digits. Display appropriate result. 
Here's my attempt:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int num, sum=0;
	printf("Enter number to check: ");
	scanf("%d", &num);

	/* Move the decimal places to right of decimal point */
	float numf = (float) num;
	while (numf >= 1) {
		numf /= 10;
		printf("%f\n", numf);
	}

	/* 
	 * Move number to left one place at a time and add the extracted int 
	 * To calculate the sum of digits 
	 */
	printf("Decimal point form: %f\n", numf);
	while(numf <= (float) num) {
		numf *= 10;
		sum += (int) numf;
		numf -= (int) numf;
		printf("%d %f", sum, numf);
	}

	/*
	 * Check if number is divisible by sum of digits
	 */
	if (num%sum == 0) {
		printf("Is divisible\n");
	}
	else {
		printf("Is not divisible\n");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

29/03/2023, 10:41 pm - +91 78297 70134: what
29/03/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: Like they give a circuit
29/03/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: You gotta apply star n delta
29/03/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 78297 70134: Yeah what's your question
29/03/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: Or will they give an ABC star or delta
29/03/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: Then ask to convert

02/04/2023, 10:48 pm - +91 77188 25988: Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt
Erika
Heiß von hunderttausend kleinen Bienelein
Wird umschwärmt
Erika
Denn ihr Herz ist voller Süßigkeit
Zarter Duft entströmt dem Blütenkleid
Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt
Erika
In der Heimat wohnt ein blondes Mägdelein
Und das heißt
Erika
Dieses Mädel ist mein treues Schätzelein
Und mein Glück
Erika
Wenn das Heidekraut rot-lila blüht
Singe ich zum Gruß ihr dieses Lied
Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt
Erika
In mein'm Kämmerlein blüht auch ein Blümelein
Und das heißt
Erika
Schon beim Morgengrau'n sowie beim Dämmerschein
Schaut's mich an
Erika
Und dann ist es mir, als spräch' es laut
"Denkst du auch an deine kleine Braut?"
In der Heimat weint um dich ein Mägdelein
Und das heißt
Erika

03/04/2023, 11:48 am - +91 91087 96229: Tried making this exact app a year ago
It would also show u AR views of some highlight dishes of the restaurant
Went and asked a lot of people
And restaurants
Everyone said yeah cool
No one wanted to use the finished product lol
03/04/2023, 11:49 am - +91 91087 96229: We went and asked in hsr and then koramangala
03/04/2023, 11:50 am - +91 96323 92436: try with 5 ⭐ hotels
03/04/2023, 11:51 am - +91 91087 96229: Good luck approaching them
03/04/2023, 11:53 am - +91 91087 96229: We went to like the premium Udupis, third wave coffee and some other guys at the top end iirc
03/04/2023, 11:53 am - +91 91087 96229: And then the random udupis and small dhaba type restaurants at the lower end
03/04/2023, 11:53 am - +91 91087 96229: The problem wasn't that they didn't want to use
03/04/2023, 11:54 am - +91 91087 96229: The problem was that we would have to pay money to develop an initial base of users (restaurants and people who customers)
03/04/2023, 11:54 am - +91 91087 96229: And it would take a lot of money so we left it

PES moment
04/04/2023, 12:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nahh my ap let's you pre-book your meal before you go to a restaurant
04/04/2023, 12:12 pm - +91 96061 40554: Send
04/04/2023, 12:12 pm - +91 96061 40554: Different kinda waste management
04/04/2023, 12:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: Instead of waiting after you order your food
04/04/2023, 12:12 pm - +91 72900 58727: Question: what do you do if I decide not to go to the restaurant after ordering some food?
04/04/2023, 12:12 pm - +91 91087 96229: Yeah we had that as well
04/04/2023, 12:13 pm - +91 91087 96229: Lol it had the ar and that
04/04/2023, 12:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: Same as Uber. What if you decide you don't want a cab after you book one?
04/04/2023, 12:13 pm - +91 96061 40554: Then they'll probably make you pay first then order
04/04/2023, 12:13 pm - +91 72900 58727: I cancel the trip…but what abt the food you’ve made at the restaurant?
04/04/2023, 12:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: There's a cancellation fee. Depends on if you meal is underway. If not, cancellation is free
04/04/2023, 12:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: If fresh enough, gets used for another meal, takeaway, delivery
04/04/2023, 12:14 pm - +91 96061 40554: Or come up with some ola money type system where they can just deduct money
04/04/2023, 12:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: Relax y'all the project is still nascent. Although investors are ready to hear us out
04/04/2023, 12:16 pm - +91 97418 00513: But basic qn. Y'all would use an app that let's you pre order? Let's say booking fee is very low, around 3% of bill?
04/04/2023, 12:16 pm - +91 97418 00513: It also reserves a table for you
04/04/2023, 12:17 pm - +91 81056 35154: Idk what problem your app is solving but good work lol

04/04/2023, 12:20 pm - +91 91087 96229: @919741800513 u can't make money from taking a cut out of the order
04/04/2023, 12:20 pm - +91 91087 96229: Neither the restaurant nor the customer is willing to pay
04/04/2023, 12:20 pm - +91 91087 96229: Trust me I've checked
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: U have to do it lime this
Collect the money for the order and keep it
At the end of the month u pay the restaurant the full amount

In between this money is urs
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: The restaurant would have to pay a subscription monthly, in order to use our platform
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: They wont
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: We checked
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 81056 35154: What is the problem that you are trying to solve
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Customers pay a cut off their bill. 3%
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: They wont
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: So if you have a bill of 800
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 90197 96534: But aren't they doing u favour by using ur service?
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: That's only 24
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: What u do is
U make the customer put money in the app
So now u have the money
And they pay the restaurants from that
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Still gotta make money
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 91087 96229: U essentially become a bank
04/04/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 81056 35154: @919108796229 is it the same thing as urs and manas
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: Yes exactly the same
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 81056 35154: Yea so definitely no problems being solved
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 6366 682 139: The restaurant would pay but idts the customers would
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: Exactly
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 90197 96534: The restaurant also won't
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: They wont
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: We checked
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 90197 96534: Idts atlleast
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 91087 96229: Until u r as big as zomato they dgaf
04/04/2023, 12:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: We start off free obviously. Will have to burn through the year
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 6366 682 139: They would, coz it will help em ryt
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 90197 96534: No
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 90197 96534: They can make more money through Zomato etc
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 91087 96229: U make the users deposit money into the app and then pay from that for orders
This way uget a lot of working capital
Then u only pay the restaurants at the end of the month so this way u keep the money for a month extra
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 90197 96534: Eventhough Zomato takes a good chunk of their revenue
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 97418 00513: No chance they'll pay newcomers
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yeah one thing is you should be a big enough brand for em to pay
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 91087 96229: The money should basically circulate within ur platform for ad long as possible
04/04/2023, 12:23 pm - +91 97418 00513: You gotta prove your app makes me money
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 97418 00513: Em*
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yes
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 90197 96534: I didn't understand how this works?

04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 90197 96534: But where ru getting money?
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Ever heard of fixed deposit??
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 91087 96229: How will u make money
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 91087 96229: Without taking a cut
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 91087 96229: Noone is gonna pay u
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 91087 96229: That's the whole point
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ah ok
04/04/2023, 12:24 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Deposits!
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Ahh that way
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 90197 96534: U take a cut of what?
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 90197 96534: The money they deposit or the money spent on orders?
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: U become a bank essentially and make the money circulate within u for as long as possible
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: Then u put this money to work
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yeah exactly, what's the starting investment??
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 90197 96534: Wait it has to be the latter only
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: So u aren't charging anyone extra money
But u r still making money
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: A lot
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: U have to pay to get users
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 6366 682 139: No i mean the source
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: In India it's v v hard I've tried w a guy from ec campus and a guy from singapore
04/04/2023, 12:25 pm - +91 90197 96534: Investors
04/04/2023, 12:26 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Assuming that it is a student doing it
04/04/2023, 12:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: Wait a minute
04/04/2023, 12:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: @919108796229

04/04/2023, 12:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: Did you like ask for payment in your first year?
04/04/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 97418 00513: Coz no one will pay for an unproven app
04/04/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 91087 96229: Nope
No one was willing to pay us
Neither customers nor restaurants 
Investment wasn't a problem
But how would we pay em back
04/04/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 91087 96229: Exactly
04/04/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 91087 96229: That's what I'm saying
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: @919741800513 come dms and I'll tell u our experience if it helps?
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 6366 682 139: A very small extra fee could be charged ryt
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Nope
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Like a rupee or 2

04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 6366 682 139: C'mon like service charge??
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: No one wants to give
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 81056 35154: For me it's kinda pointless , this business isn't solving any problems in the industry and coming from a family who have been in restaurant business I can say no one would be ready to pay
04/04/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Better than nothing
04/04/2023, 12:29 pm - +91 91087 96229: see there r two problems
1. u need to spend money to get users by giving freebies like cashbacks and discounts that r exclusive to ur platfomr, especially in the begining
2. u need to find a sustainable way to make money
04/04/2023, 12:29 pm - +91 91087 96229: 1. u can ignore for now that u need investors
04/04/2023, 12:29 pm - +91 91087 96229: for 2.
the issue is that unless u charge like 1 inr no one wlil pay u (especially if u r new(
04/04/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But how will you even get the starting capital then??
04/04/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: Sure
04/04/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 91087 96229: so what u do is
1. make customers deposit money into the app, and pay for orders thry this money rather than making them pay separately for each order
2. at the end of every month, pay the restaurants the total amount of money rather than pay them for each order
04/04/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 91087 96229: this way the money remains in circulation within ur platform for as long as possible
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 91087 96229: u can do stuff with this money at this point
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 91087 96229: investors
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 91087 96229: the only way to charge restaurants is if u ardvertise them and have them appear on top
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 77758 82781: <Media omitted>
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 91087 96229: so u can say that our platform has like a restaurant of the week thing where each restaurant can bid or wtvr
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: See
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I do
04/04/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 91087 96229: and stuff like that
04/04/2023, 12:32 pm - +91 77758 82781: Do u mind sending it?
04/04/2023, 12:32 pm - +91 91087 96229: u cant charge a cut off of orders
even if u do, its definitely not gonna happen until u r as big as zomato or swiggy
04/04/2023, 12:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: No one will give you money if they feel you don't really solve a problem for them. Customers won't pay that 3% if they don't feel we're saving their time. Restaurants won't pay if they don't feel we're helping them organise better/ getting them more customers.
04/04/2023, 12:32 pm - +91 91087 96229: because this app will primarly not be used by high end restaurants and hotels
u go there to enjoy the overall experience not just the food
so people want to stay there for a long time
04/04/2023, 12:33 pm - +91 91087 96229: and the udupi audience wont pay u
04/04/2023, 12:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: When it comes down to these subscription type apps, you've got to prove to your b2b partners that there's money being made for them
04/04/2023, 12:33 pm - +91 97418 00513: Initially, they won't beleive you. Why should they?
04/04/2023, 12:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: You've got to prove that this really works.
04/04/2023, 12:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: Your problem was people didn't pay right?
04/04/2023, 12:34 pm - +91 77953 89834: True
04/04/2023, 12:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: But did it help restaurants organise better? Did it save customers time? Did it help restaurants get more customers? Did it ? Then you solved a problem. Should have waited to build trust

14/04/2023, 5:10 pm - +91 97418 00513: I will Absolutely murder the motherfuckers who thought the horror house was a good idea.  Y'all grilled me for that start up of mine which is pretty decent-ish so idek what y'all gonna say for this absolute best crap of a horror house. 

For beginners, they started 2 hours late. The chick hosting it was too busy fixing her blouse and taking pics.

This shit took place in the ground floor lab of the b block. It couldn't scare off a schizophrenic cat if the setting had to.
Anyways, after you enter this "horror house" which makes Mumbai houses look like mansions, there's this dude behind a thermocol door to welcome you. Not too bad tbh, just so yk, he seemed like a pro when compared to other, uhhhh, scarers

While the entire lab was divided into 3 segments by a 1975 porn movie curtain, there was this weird ass Jack o lantern when you enter that looked like he shot himself through his gut.

Now comes the first scare. When you make the turn there's this chick with a God damn Samsung phone light flashing on her face, YK, to create a ghost effect. Kudos to the costume department, went overboard with creativity, with that phone. Anyways she starts to follow you for like 5 meters and then she goes back to texting on that phone


After you make another "turn" you enter another "alley" where a guy in a rabbit costume jerking off on the God damn floor greets you with a very passionate "boo". I've seen louder libraries y'all


Now comes the final score, the climax. A guy dressed in his unwashed bed sheet, whom you see. Hiding behind the other lab even before you enter comes running at you screaming like a stuck pig. It's almost like HE was the one getting chased by a ghost. 

Seriously guys, what a crap experience, ik you can't expect much for 70 but damn,

0 for creativity
0 for punctuality
0 for acting
100 for the selfies these people took while we waited for 2 hrs for this shit


Tl;Dr if you have spare 70 bucks and enthusiasm up your butt, spend it on a chicken roll

14/04/2023, 5:48 pm - +91 97395 33665: Dayum. But the actual question is how did you have so much hopes on PES to get so disappointed.......
14/04/2023, 5:51 pm - +91 82475 22142: 🫡
14/04/2023, 6:09 pm - +91 74112 64188: 💯
14/04/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: Actually lol. Coz the see hog heaven was actually good lol. They literally gave cavins even though we paid just 100
14/04/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 97418 00513: And 4 bun samosas

14/04/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 97418 00513: Lolz apparently every other event was decent, only the Horror house team was incompetent
14/04/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 81056 35154: i wish i had a screw driver when i saw that mini amusent park shit , nice blood shower i would get to see
14/04/2023, 8:29 pm - +91 96320 07839: Milind😂😂
14/04/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: If you wanted to see a blood shower, open the Qmin chicken into half
14/04/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 97395 33665: Add sahil shah to the disappointment list
14/04/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 97418 00513: Oh yea, what was he? Comedian pr singer

14/04/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 97395 33665: You didnt attend??
14/04/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: Obviously not
14/04/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: Horror house "hogged" my dissatpointment quota
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Amogh carried Sahil
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97395 33665: Good save
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97395 33665: Yessss
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: But why was Sahil bad
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97395 33665: Man made midlife crisis jokes and asked us to relate to it
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 81056 35154: now that i have heard his voice rn on youtube , his voice is more funny then the comedy he does
14/04/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: His jokes were basically roasts and nothing else, he was not bad, he was decent his starting and last few jokes were good
14/04/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 84315 27126: man why'd u even attend, his youtube jokes are so cringe
14/04/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 94839 91979: Bro Niroop was good bro
14/04/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 84315 27126: mfs in the comment section are giving him death threats
14/04/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 80736 35736: Always
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 81056 35154: why didnt anybody throw shoes , water bottles etc
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 94839 91979: Niroop had zero filters today
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 97395 33665: Thats cause he roasted PES and it was relatable. The middle part was all not at all relatable
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah exactly
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 94839 91979: Too much effort
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 97418 00513: PES would charge us to do that
14/04/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 94839 91979: I mean he did get the ac temperature better kind off
14/04/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 97395 33665: Nah my shoes are costlier than his worth....
14/04/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 78927 60478: There was acs also ah
14/04/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 81056 35154: why would they give a fuck lol
14/04/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 94839 91979: I think so
14/04/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 81056 35154: man was irrelevant anyway not  that he was some big shot
14/04/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 97418 00513: /s
14/04/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nahh i meant PES would sell shoes to throw on comedians
14/04/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: You'd need tokens to buy those tho
14/04/2023, 8:39 pm - +91 81056 35154: this is the most usefull thing i have seen in life
14/04/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 94839 91979: They should've started off with sahil and ended with Niroop
14/04/2023, 8:42 pm - +91 94839 91979: Many people were bored cuz they didn't understand kannada properly
14/04/2023, 8:43 pm - +91 94839 91979: And Niroop was much better
14/04/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 97418 00513: Wait Niroop spoke on Kannada?
14/04/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 97395 33665: Obviously. He does only Kannada standup
14/04/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 87627 37914: So what u guys think, was it a waste of money?
14/04/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 87627 37914: And time?
14/04/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 96868 63016: Why ??

14/04/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 94839 91979: It was good only bro had fun, but eh the waiting in the sun sucked
14/04/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 87627 37914: So i was just askin ki was the spent for the ticket really worth it??

14/04/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 97412 33739: For Niroop it was worth 🔥
14/04/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 6361 790 234: when will PES students learn, you get a free horror house experience when your isa marks come out.
14/04/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 6361 790 234: I'm a little bummed tho, they managed to get Thaikkudam Bridge for AT years back, and now we don't have artists as good as they are

18/04/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 74112 64188: Reflection is max
18/04/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 6360 508 139: The thing is wave function shud be finite
18/04/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 6360 508 139: But it bcms infinite, so to avoid that the constant C is taken as 0
18/04/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 94495 71975: it doesnt become infinite in region 2  , x varies from -a/2 to a/2 only ,so finite value🤔
18/04/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Bro indhudar told like that 🥲
18/04/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 91488 60269: Yah.. 0 to L.. So in that region, psi will be finite only no.. Then why are we not considering that term?
18/04/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 94495 71975: oh , understandable have a great day 🫡
18/04/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 94499 22481: It represents the decay
18/04/2023, 10:37 pm - +91 74112 64188: Here the wave function moves only forward.
18/04/2023, 10:46 pm - +91 94839 91979: You can think of it as the energy of the particle decreasing, the more it moves through the potential, the more it loses it energy, lesser the energy less likely that it can be found over there
18/04/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 94839 91979: That's why psi decreases as you move along the barrier and there is no point in it reflecting from the other side of the barrier, because it's coming out of the wall, so it doesn't make sense for it to reflect back
18/04/2023, 10:48 pm - +91 94839 91979: So yeah you can take C as 0 because it doesn't make sense for C to be anything non zero
18/04/2023, 10:48 pm - +91 94839 91979: I think this is the answer, this made sense to me atleast
18/04/2023, 10:51 pm - +91 73532 91375: Manas ji to the rescue

19/04/2023, 2:51 am - +91 83101 67616: It in fact is not ignored. If we ignore the positive exponent part and solve the equations in the boundary conditions then we will end up with a transmission coefficient as 1. Ig PES decided to omit that term and just show it as decay instead of showing it as a superposition of the two terms for the sake of simplicity.
19/04/2023, 3:25 am - +91 91488 60269: Thank you so much! 🙌🏻😃
19/04/2023, 9:32 am - +91 78297 70134: There is no guarantee that the potential barrier is thin
19/04/2023, 9:33 am - +91 78297 70134: If it's wide enough then the C term can go to infinity which isn't allowed
19/04/2023, 9:33 am - +91 78297 70134: Just a guess tho idk if it's the correct ans
19/04/2023, 9:41 am - +91 88846 11078: but a potential barrier that goes to infinity is just a potential step no
19/04/2023, 9:46 am - +91 78297 70134: Nah this is Ce^(alphax) (exponential) not Ce^(ialphax) (sinusoidal)
19/04/2023, 9:46 am - +91 78297 70134: exponential functions go to infinity after a particular finite distance
19/04/2023, 9:47 am - +91 78297 70134: So if the barrier is wider than that distance we get the problem of the function going to infinity
19/04/2023, 9:47 am - +91 94834 59419: Guys my teach confirmed no lab exp comin

19/04/2023, 9:49 am - +91 88846 11078: yes but we're defining the width of the barrier to be finite
19/04/2023, 9:49 am - +91 88846 11078: an infinite barrier is a step
19/04/2023, 9:49 am - +91 88846 11078: which is like a different case
19/04/2023, 9:50 am - +91 88846 11078: i don't think they ever discussed the height of the barrier no?? like just the boundaries on the sides
19/04/2023, 9:50 am - +91 88846 11078: i don't remember there being an upper bound
19/04/2023, 9:50 am - +91 88846 11078: bc it's 1 dimensional
19/04/2023, 9:53 am - +91 78297 70134: Ok wait this is confusing me a little too
19/04/2023, 9:54 am - +91 88846 11078: idk how to explain over text 😭

This proof uses both the terms in region 2

19/04/2023, 10:14 am - +91 6361 790 234: we did.

the height is what we defined as V=0 till V=Vo

And of course, for the infinite potential case, height is infinite

there's not much emphasis on barrier width per se. Other than having to calculate according to the boundary values.

It's an insult to Minecraft villagers if you call these NPCs as villagers. Minecraft has well designed villager and village mechanics.

and q is p+3


q-p will give 3

Auf der Heide blüht

ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt: Erika.
Heiß von hunderttausend
kleinen Bienelein
Wird umschwärmt Erika.
Denn ihr Herz ist voller Süßigkeit,
Zarter Duft entströmt dem Blütenkleid
Auf der Heide blüht
ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt: Erika.

In der Heimat wohnt

ein kleines Mägdelein
Und das heißt: Erika.
Dieses Mädel ist mein treues Schätzelein
Und mein Glück, Erika.
Wenn das Heidekraut rot-lila blüht,
Singe ich zum Gruß ihr dieses Lied.
Auf der Heide blüht
ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt: Erika.

20/04/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
20/04/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: Can someone solve qn 1?
20/04/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 90199 42460: Find total ways you can get a sum of 7
20/04/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 90199 42460: Divided by total outcomes (6*6*6=216)
20/04/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 97418 00513: How to do that
20/04/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 97418 00513: That's the issue lol
20/04/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 97418 00513: Answer is 91/216 i can't count tht many no
20/04/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 90199 42460: Suppose you get 2 on first dice
20/04/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 97418 00513: 6 can't come
20/04/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 90199 42460: Then you can get either 3,2 or 2,3 or 4,1 or 1,4 like that
20/04/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yes
20/04/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 90199 42460: It really won't take that long
20/04/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: But I'd have to count all these cases individually
20/04/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: There are 91
20/04/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 90199 42460: Nah, u get logic it's ez
20/04/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Logic Kodi saar
20/04/2023, 10:22 pm - +91 90199 42460: This is literally it
20/04/2023, 10:22 pm - +91 90199 42460: If you found 3,2 then you found 2 cases already
20/04/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 6360 508 139: If u do like that, the total possibilities is 15 only
20/04/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 97418 00513: Exactly
20/04/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 97418 00513: Answer is 91/216
20/04/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 80734 96504: This message was deleted
20/04/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 90199 42460: Don't trust ans always
20/04/2023, 10:27 pm - +91 90199 42460: 15/216 is correct
20/04/2023, 10:28 pm - +91 90082 75026: 5,1,1 = 3! ways
4,2,1 = 3! ways
1,3,3 = 3! ways
2,2,3 = 3! ways
Total = 24
20/04/2023, 10:28 pm - +91 90082 75026: So shouldn't it be 24/216m
20/04/2023, 10:28 pm - +91 90082 75026: ?*
20/04/2023, 10:28 pm - +91 90082 75026: If u take each dice to be unique
20/04/2023, 10:29 pm - +91 80734 96504: 5,1,1 is 3!/2! ways
20/04/2023, 10:29 pm - +91 80734 96504: same for 1,3,3 and 2,2,3
20/04/2023, 10:29 pm - +91 90082 75026: Taking dices as unique
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 6360 508 139: <Media omitted>
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 90082 75026: Dice 1, dice 2, dice 3 having their own values
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 93537 16080: Question is misleading
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 90199 42460: No bro...that's repetition
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 93537 16080: Here dice refers to 2 of them
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 90199 42460: The dice haven't been mentioned as unique
20/04/2023, 10:30 pm - +91 93537 16080: So it means probability of getting sum 7 with 3 throws of 2 dice
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 93537 16080: I did this and got the right answer
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Yep
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 90082 75026: Fair
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 93537 16080: Its 1-3c0*(5/6)^3
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 94495 71975: This seems correct tbh
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Dice = 2 
Die = 1
20/04/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 6360 508 139: S
20/04/2023, 10:32 pm - +91 93537 16080: Quite a weirdly worded question tho tbh
20/04/2023, 10:32 pm - +91 90199 42460: Whoa
20/04/2023, 10:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Exactly
20/04/2023, 10:36 pm - +91 94839 91979: The people who set up the questions need English classes fr

20/04/2023, 10:37 pm - +91 81056 35154: The answer will be 91/216 if a pair of fair dice is tossed three times
20/04/2023, 10:38 pm - +91 80734 96504: too late 
send them to gas chambers
20/04/2023, 10:38 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Well, they told dice, which is plural, dice is plural and die is a singular
20/04/2023, 10:39 pm - +91 81056 35154: Yea ik  dice can mean anh tying   it could mean 3 or 4 or 5 die as well
20/04/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 81056 35154: Dice necessarily doesn't mean 2 fair cubes
20/04/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Ah in that way. Okay
20/04/2023, 10:41 pm - +91 94839 91979: And "a" fair dice is wrong for plural right?
20/04/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Yep, I got it.
20/04/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah so concentration camp it is
20/04/2023, 10:56 pm - +91 93537 16080: Its supposed to be a pair of dice

22/04/2023, 6:59 pm - +91 99014 37680: It doesn't
22/04/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 99014 37680: Only the subjective gets saved
22/04/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 79001 15676: Also 2 qs in the not subjective part are wrong
22/04/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 99014 37680: which 2?
22/04/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 79001 15676: Sphere with diameter 12
22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 79001 15676: And the Samuel Thomas rowjee pets one
22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: oh yea

22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah
22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 99014 37680: but you can't deduce anything from the info given
22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 94839 91979: If one option is correct all three are correct
22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 79001 15676: Exactky
22/04/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 79001 15676: Exactly
22/04/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 79001 15676: I reloaded coz it kept asking me to reload
22/04/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 79001 15676: Now I have mayday
22/04/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 79001 15676: 💀
22/04/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 99014 37680: mayday?
22/04/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 82966 96682: same, i could save answers only for subjective questions so it showed me only 8/30 questions completed even tho i did all
22/04/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 79001 15676: Some mayday error it's saying once I reloaded
22/04/2023, 7:08 pm - +91 99014 37680: lmao
22/04/2023, 7:08 pm - +91 99014 37680: same
22/04/2023, 7:09 pm - +91 91488 13616: Even after submission it says 0/30 answered tf 💀
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 91488 13616: Like after ending the test
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 99014 37680: yea yea
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 99014 37680: that's why they are rescheduling
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 79001 15676: I exited test after mayday error
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 91488 13616: What bs so just exit the test eh ?
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 99014 37680: yea
22/04/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 91488 13616: I thought that was only for people who couldn't get in
22/04/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 99014 37680: nah nah
22/04/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 99014 37680: even those who got in couldn't write it
22/04/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 94839 91979: Damn
22/04/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 94839 91979: Some questions are hard
22/04/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 94839 91979: The volumes don't even match
22/04/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 94839 91979: Idk how they brought the cubes out of thin air
22/04/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 79001 15676: Yeah it should be cube of 12 side
22/04/2023, 7:18 pm - +91 79001 15676: Then the answer will be 864
22/04/2023, 7:18 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeahh
22/04/2023, 7:41 pm - +91 83107 58397: The images for two questions were jumbled up

22/04/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 99160 19977: Greetings from PES Innovation Lab!

We sincerely apologise for the issues that occurred during today's test. The sheer number of participants overloaded our test platform, 'HackerEarth', and caused it to crash for a large number of participants. While this was out of our control, we take full responsibility for any and all problems caused, and time that was wasted. 

To accommodate all participants that faced issues and did not have an ideal test experience, we will be conducting a *re-test.*
Furthermore, we will be creating _two slots_ at *_Sunday, 3:00PM_* and *_Monday, 6:00PM_* 

Those who *did not face any issues whatsoever, _need not_* write the retests.

The test will consist mainly of *MCQs hosted on AutoProctor and the link will be mailed to you before your slot.* 

We will be sending Sunday's test link to your mails by 12:00pm on Sunday. If you are unable to write this test, Monday's test link will be sent on Monday, by 4:30pm, to your inbox.

You will only be allowed to *attempt it once*, and the link will be _*personalised*_, so that *_sharing_* or *_attempting it on both Sunday and Monday_* it will result in an automatic disqualification.

We wish you all the very best for the test, and look forward to seeing you there!  

Mark your calendars, and see you there!

23/04/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 94839 91979: There are 5 red balls, 4 blue balls and 3 green balls in how many ways can you arrange them in a row such that same colours don't be next to each other
23/04/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 94839 91979: How do you solve this one?
23/04/2023, 2:50 pm - +91 99025 42502: Can anyone access the PIL test? It just shows '502 Bad Gateway'
23/04/2023, 2:51 pm - +91 93537 16080: Gg
23/04/2023, 2:54 pm - +91 6366 682 139: will start at 3, refresh it then and check again
23/04/2023, 2:54 pm - +91 80882 73401: You have to assume that first you keep one colour and the next can be like permutations of different ones. It goes lengthy though
23/04/2023, 2:56 pm - +91 80882 73401: The reason it goes lengthy is something like if you fix red to be first ball then the next position will be either blue or green but the third position again it will depend on the second
23/04/2023, 2:57 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah exactly you'll have to add up everything later then
23/04/2023, 2:57 pm - +91 80882 73401: So better try with the green ball being placed first so that easily a general way can be developed for higher number of coloured balls
23/04/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro why don't you try taking 3 of each color first
23/04/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 94495 71975: <Media omitted>
23/04/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 90199 42460: And then arranging them, then repeating units of 3
23/04/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 99014 37680: mood
23/04/2023, 2:59 pm - +91 77220 90103: Find all the total ways to arrange and subtract the number of ways in which all the same colors are in row
23/04/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 90199 42460: That also pretty hard
23/04/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 93537 16080: Problem is it says any 2 not all together
23/04/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 80882 73401: we dont know three of each will be repeated again . the sequence may go like GRGBGRBG something like that
23/04/2023, 3:01 pm - +91 90199 42460: Yeah, but it'll solve 50% of the question
23/04/2023, 3:17 pm - +91 99025 42502: This message was deleted
23/04/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 81056 35154: The most simplest way is to PIE bash
23/04/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 81056 35154: if you want a more general way then you can solve it with generating function or make use of the generalized laguerre polynomial
23/04/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 81056 35154: using laguerre the permuation would be integral 0 to inf e^-t ( product i =1 to k  Lni(t)) dt where k would be number of different balls
23/04/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 81056 35154: can even get a generalized formula which is basically the extension of PIE
23/04/2023, 4:44 pm - +91 94839 91979: Thenkss

29/04/2023, 1:26 pm - +91 6361 790 234: and of course, hugh jackman
29/04/2023, 1:27 pm - +91 6361 790 234: they brought in some directors whose shows didnt lift off either
29/04/2023, 1:27 pm - +91 6361 790 234: 18 episodes, 30 minutes... the fuck is 30 mins

29/04/2023, 1:28 pm - +91 6361 790 234: his Netflix costume was so appropriate with his character
29/04/2023, 1:28 pm - +91 6361 790 234: his role in she hulk was just.. to come and smash her and leave
29/04/2023, 1:29 pm - +91 94495 71975: quite literally
29/04/2023, 1:30 pm - +91 6361 790 234: not expecting much, if it sucks, I'm chill
29/04/2023, 5:08 pm - +91 90197 96534: Transformers
29/04/2023, 5:10 pm - +91 90197 96534: Hopefully the new one is good
29/04/2023, 5:23 pm - +91 6361 790 234: it has been a while although
29/04/2023, 5:24 pm - +91 6361 790 234: its first three movies were cornerstones for cgi
29/04/2023, 5:24 pm - +91 6361 790 234: but the 4th one wasn't as good, although enjoyable yes. The next one was plain disappointing
29/04/2023, 5:26 pm - +91 90197 96534: Fax
29/04/2023, 5:28 pm - +91 90197 96534: I hope it's a good one tho
29/04/2023, 5:29 pm - +91 6361 790 234: no harm in hoping but, the only time a sequel TRULY delivered in recent years is john wick
29/04/2023, 5:29 pm - +91 6361 790 234: endgame was nearly 4 years ago, so I'm not counting it xD
29/04/2023, 5:31 pm - +91 94495 71975: Endgame was last decade so doesn't even matter 🤣
29/04/2023, 5:31 pm - +91 90197 96534: Faxxx
29/04/2023, 5:32 pm - +91 90197 96534: John wick 4 was prolly the best one
29/04/2023, 5:49 pm - +91 99014 37680: The action, yes
But the dialogue and the build up was the best in the first movie
29/04/2023, 5:49 pm - +91 90197 96534: Yes
29/04/2023, 5:52 pm - +91 89042 32230: Agreed

07/05/2023, 10:30 am - +91 94839 91979: You won't even get those terms to be honest, it gets cancelled out in the previous equation, but they decided to write it, and then equate it to 0, idky
07/05/2023, 10:31 am - +91 6360 508 139: They cancelled -18 but forgot to cancel +9 and +9 , so they wrote it again ig
07/05/2023, 11:12 am - +91 78998 03080: hhmmmm... makes sense TQ

07/05/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 94495 71975: theres a reason i asked for the steps , cause i have alr tried the formula 😐

07/05/2023, 5:05 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro can't we use the formula 3*iph^2*R here??
07/05/2023, 5:06 pm - +91 74836 11935: Its total power
07/05/2023, 5:07 pm - +91 74836 11935: Not that o e read in wattmeter
07/05/2023, 5:08 pm - +91 76187 12509: Oh thx

07/05/2023, 6:09 pm - +91 94495 71975: whats the logic for taking the reading to be w1-w2 rather than w1+w2
07/05/2023, 6:09 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro why w1-w2??
07/05/2023, 6:10 pm - +91 74836 11935: Bro there is only 1 whatt meter right then how can we take w1-w2
07/05/2023, 6:13 pm - +91 83107 58397: star circuit, Vph is approximately 231V not 400
07/05/2023, 6:14 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro he has done 400÷ root3 there
07/05/2023, 6:14 pm - +91 83107 58397: oh right my bad

07/05/2023, 7:39 pm - +91 83101 67616: If you observe there is no pressure coil which would mean the wattmeter is measuring only the reactive input power . Since y and b lines are shorted with the same coil i just took that w2 - w1 formula of two wattmeter method
07/05/2023, 7:39 pm - +91 83101 67616: You can directly calculate the reactive power of the supply as VI sin(phi)
07/05/2023, 7:43 pm - +91 76187 12509: Thx bro

They don't give a shit abt u
14/05/2023, 10:21 am - +91 91087 96229: The only way to make them even consider thinking abt what anyone has to say is if they loose a considerable amount of money or their "brand" is at stake

If 10 students  in furst year decide to drop out and tell the VC that they r working on some ideas
And those ideas work out and those students mention that they dripped from pes to make it

Then pes would give a  shit
Coz now suddenly people will start doubting their brand and they lost the fees from those 10 students for 3 yrs
14/05/2023, 10:22 am - +91 91087 96229: But that is not gonna happen is it
14/05/2023, 10:22 am - +91 91087 96229: Stop sending these surveys it makes you look retarded

14/05/2023, 12:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: Everyone does that
14/05/2023, 12:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: I've personally known people who have lost their IDs 3-4 times and just gotten a fake one everytime.
14/05/2023, 12:28 pm - +91 94495 71975: how do u do that btw
14/05/2023, 12:30 pm - Aditeya Baral: Get your friend to scan a high res copy of their ID card, front and back. Use Gimp or Photoshop to simply put your picture on top of it, the font is a standard font which I've forgotten, use that to update the name and other details
14/05/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 94495 71975: 😳👍
14/05/2023, 12:31 pm - +91 78998 03080: How to print it out

14/05/2023, 12:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: Most printing shops can do it
14/05/2023, 12:37 pm - +91 78998 03080: So the ones near college can do it uhh?
14/05/2023, 12:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: A little more professional ones. Not the Xerox shops dude

14/05/2023, 4:19 pm - Aditeya Baral: I didn't get it done, but my friends did. Search for big printing shops or search for ID card printing on Google, you'll get it
14/05/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 78297 70134: What about the tag?
14/05/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 73532 91375: U have to buy it in pes

14/05/2023, 4:31 pm - +91 73532 91375: Really?
14/05/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 73532 91375: I thought u have to use the PES one only
14/05/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 95350 42904: I mean I've been wearing it, nobody said anything 
Moreover I don't think their interested in the tag rather than the id card itself . So,
14/05/2023, 4:33 pm - +91 90083 45926: I walked into the office one time saying i needed one and they gave it to me without much hassle , but other people have had worse experiences than this from what I've heard
14/05/2023, 4:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: They usually don't care about the tag. You can always say you lost it. The tag isn't as important as the actual card

20/05/2023, 11:04 am - +91 90199 42460: This is what CET 2nd batch did last sem
20/05/2023, 11:04 am - +91 94495 71975: yeah and internal mark calc did get messed up
20/05/2023, 11:05 am - +91 94495 71975: well we did 2 40m and 1 20m one
20/05/2023, 11:06 am - +91 77188 25988: Bruh so what? Will it be best of 3 or Something?
20/05/2023, 11:08 am - +91 99025 42502: Last isa(4+5) will definitely be considered for 20/40 internal marks. Rest 20 come from best 2 out 3
20/05/2023, 11:08 am - +91 99025 42502: I’m guessing
20/05/2023, 11:09 am - +91 94495 71975: they gonna divide the 40 marks to both units respectively and still be best 4 out of 5
20/05/2023, 11:10 am - +91 99014 37680: this is how we had exams until last year

such a good scheme
20/05/2023, 11:10 am - +91 94495 71975: whats ur current exam pattern ?
20/05/2023, 11:11 am - +91 99014 37680: 5 isa

20/05/2023, 12:07 pm - +91 6360 374 242: Why not pessat after 2nd sem ?
20/05/2023, 12:08 pm - +91 94495 71975: if they keep pessat after 2nd sem they wont be able to start the next 1st year with us in august
20/05/2023, 12:12 pm - +91 78998 03080: I think they will just segregate the marks for 4th and 5th isa
20/05/2023, 12:13 pm - +91 74836 11935: 😂😂
20/05/2023, 12:14 pm - +91 74836 11935: Its same as the 2nd round cet students ..in last sem

22/05/2023, 12:02 pm - +91 79090 33467: From next sem , three ISAs will be held.

ISA1- U1+U2
ISA2- U3+U4
ISA3- U5

Best 4 to be taken
22/05/2023, 12:40 pm - +91 91087 96229: So best *4 out of 3* isas will be considered?
This is a certified Rahul gandhi moment
22/05/2023, 12:41 pm - +91 90197 96534: No
22/05/2023, 12:41 pm - +91 90197 96534: Exam is conducted together
22/05/2023, 12:41 pm - +91 90197 96534: But unit marks will bw chosen individually
22/05/2023, 12:41 pm - +91 94495 71975: No , since the the marks are divided equally still across units 
Best of 4 out of 5 units marks
22/05/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: Like if u got 35/40 in isa 1
22/05/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: Unit1-15
Unit 2-20
22/05/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: Like that
22/05/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ig
22/05/2023, 12:46 pm - +91 81608 33258: I think  2 best ISA out of 3 will be considered
22/05/2023, 12:48 pm - +91 6361 631 974: that's kinda shit though, because from what op mentioned its 1 and 2 together, 3 and 4 and then 5th isa all alone. That's very unbalanced.
22/05/2023, 12:50 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ye they might introduce a 6th unit
22/05/2023, 12:50 pm - +91 90197 96534: That's why our maths teacher said it might not happen
22/05/2023, 12:50 pm - +91 90197 96534: Anyway it's all hearsay until VC confirms it
22/05/2023, 12:50 pm - +91 6361 631 974: hmm
22/05/2023, 1:03 pm - +91 96061 40554: Why😭
22/05/2023, 1:03 pm - +91 96061 40554: Just remove the 5th unit
22/05/2023, 1:03 pm - +91 81608 33258: The info is the system is going back to 3 ISA system so seniors @919901437680 how will be the exam pattern??
22/05/2023, 1:10 pm - +91 90197 96534: For seniors it was 2 isa if I'm not wrong?
22/05/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 99014 37680: We had 2 isa
22/05/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 99014 37680: And they used to consider both
22/05/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 99014 37680: Isa 1 u1 u2
Isa 2 u2 u3

Didn't have isa for u5
22/05/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 99014 37680: 40 marks
1 hour
22/05/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 99014 37680: Imho much better than 5 isa
Cause you won't have the constant dread of exam class exam class
22/05/2023, 1:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: On the downside, ISAs used to be much harder and the best 4 score didn't exist. You screw up one ISA and your grade goes down
22/05/2023, 1:38 pm - +91 99014 37680: Agreed
But the gap would allow you to prep properly
22/05/2023, 1:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: True, but there was more on the line for each test
22/05/2023, 1:39 pm - +91 90197 96534: And from 2nd year it's whatever course u took
22/05/2023, 1:40 pm - +91 90197 96534: So it's not useless stuff I assume
22/05/2023, 1:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: But that doesn't make it easier to score lol
22/05/2023, 1:56 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ya lol

To people who are scared that chatgpt has abilities to reduce IT jobs. Check this thread once. Count number of times it went wrong. What are your opinions over this? (No editing. this is my own thread.)
11/06/2023, 9:10 am - +91 6361 790 234: i hear it takes 3 days to run even a few epochs and train models. Ask it to describe recent events in sports history and it will make up its own stories.

but it will still replace a lot of jobs, maybe not the ones that require intuition, but GPT4 is apparently really fluent in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Being interdisciplinary has never been more important than now
11/06/2023, 9:16 am - +91 94495 71975: It's 1 year old , 2-3 if you include the data feeding process and what not

Basically it's still a toddler, so don't get too far ahead of yourself thinking it can't replace jobs 
Maybe it can't rn , but in 4-5 years it for sure is
11/06/2023, 10:32 am - +91 83103 70225: I’ve heard the one which is available for everyone is just a small part of the AI developed,so you never know
11/06/2023, 10:37 am - Aditeya Baral: Although LMs are universal learners, it simply replicates intuition, it doesn't build it. Fluency in programming languages came with GPT3 as well as other encoder-decoder models (check out CodeT5). GPT4's main novelty comes from its multi modal training and RLHF
11/06/2023, 10:39 am - Aditeya Baral: If you're looking at more specific use cases for logic, there are more pedantic models out there than LMs. Tasks like solving math word problems don't use LMs at all.
11/06/2023, 11:12 am - +91 6361 790 234: thats there, but LLMs are more commercial at the moment, and largely form the view of what people perceive as "AI".

Which leads to people saying half-educated statements such as "GPT can't pass jee or any of those exams". To imagine any of these models are capable of heuristics, even if it merely replicates it, terrifying.
11/06/2023, 11:12 am - +91 6361 790 234: will read up on these, thank you very much!
11/06/2023, 11:43 am - Aditeya Baral: Commercial because as I said, universal learners. Theoretically they can learn anything - you can even use a LM to perform binary classification. But again, not the model for this. You'd be better off with a more specialised model for these purposes. As for solving questions, a lot of models do surprisingly well on questions. If you aren't aware, check out Minerva by Google. It can solve JEE questions if I remember correctly.
11/06/2023, 11:44 am - Aditeya Baral: Note - Minerva is a LLM, but it uses something called Chain of Thought (CoT) to solve

12/06/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 6366 682 139: The lab exam was conducted in the F Block computer labs. We gotta write our name on the blue book before going in, so that swapping is impossible. Inside we gotta pick a chit to choose the topic, and teacher writes it on the top using red pen. No loopholes there, too. We gotta type the program in a guest account of the lab PC, so no internet. Around 3 teachers monitor the exam, on rounds, so invigilation is pretty strict. Randomly seated. Type the program first, execute, then write both program and output, and then they'll check it and grade it.

That's all.


EDIT: Also, please familiarise yourselves with the working of the Terminal in Ubuntu, and how to execute a program using GCC, so that you won't face issues in the lab. <This message was edited>

12/06/2023, 7:55 pm - +91 84314 78734: Dear Students, you need to submit Experiential Learning Component (SIMULINK REPORT) for EEE course based on the following instructions:

1. A PDF with questions is shared here. Only one question must be solved as follows:
Question 1 must be solved by Students with section roll numbers 1 - 20
Question 2 must be solved by Students with section roll numbers 21 - 40
Question 3 must be solved by Students with section roll numbers 41 - 60
Question 4 must be solved by Students with section roll numbers 61 & above

2. 
A word document is shared here, which has some prefilled fields. You need to develop following simulation models for the given circuit in MATLAB SIMULINK.
i) Given circuit with ammeter in load branch and display the current value
ii) A circuit to find Thevenin's Voltage (Vth) & display its value
iii) A circuit to find Thevenin's Resistance (Rth) & display its value
iv) Thevenin's Equivalent of the given circuit & display load current.
Take screenshots of developed simulation circuits and paste in the allocated spaces in the word document.

3. 
After that, take a printout of the document & solve the given circuit using Thevenin's method in detail (as learnt in Unit 1) in the space allocated for 'Theoretical Calculations' 

4.
Fill the table in the last page for Theoretical and Simulated Values.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1.
Enter your name, SRN, section, Roll No. & date in the first sheet and submit the hard copy on or before 14-06-2023 (WEDNESDAY) beyond which it won't be considered.

2. Theoretical calculations must be done in blue pen only. Typed calculations will not be considered.

12/06/2023, 7:56 pm - +91 94495 71975: bruh i need the final values for set 4 qn , so i can check if i have done my simulation properly 😐
12/06/2023, 7:56 pm - +91 94495 71975: cause im getting negative values for current lmao
12/06/2023, 7:57 pm - +91 94834 59419: same
12/06/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 6366 634 666: Even I need to confirm the values, I got Vth = -18.57 , Rth = 12.57 , i = -0.8228
12/06/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 94495 71975: yeah same values
12/06/2023, 9:14 pm - +91 94495 71975: so in the table do we write the negative value itself ?

13/06/2023, 12:22 am - +91 6361 790 234: we saw what happened when they tried to impose net neutrality

13/06/2023, 12:22 am - +91 6361 790 234: im rather confident with this API thing
13/06/2023, 12:22 am - +91 94495 71975: Hopefully, more than 93% of the subs are protesting tbh
13/06/2023, 12:23 am - +91 6361 790 234: reddit knows we can just change our preferences
13/06/2023, 12:24 am - +91 6361 790 234: the amount of people that shifted to signal because WhatsApp had that controversy itself is proof
13/06/2023, 6:48 am - +91 6366 682 139: But then is there a solid alternative to reddit?? Coz some users are permanently quitting reddit, so an alternative ought to be made
13/06/2023, 8:07 am - +91 88675 28866: Check out lemmy
13/06/2023, 8:13 am - +91 94495 71975: nothings gonna replace reddit 
its not about the new interactions which is gonna be a problem
if the subreddits go dark forever , a lot of important info on most random and niche topics are lost forever imo
13/06/2023, 8:32 am - +91 88675 28866: The problem of subreddit going dark is something reddit has to worry abt not us users, i believe most of the ppl who use old.reddit,rif and 3rd party apps will leave
13/06/2023, 8:38 am - +91 94495 71975: as i said , reddit is home to info which u probably wont get anywhere else on the entire internet , so its gonna become a general person's problem as well after some point in time 
imagine u search for some issue on google and the answers are available on a random subreddit , u click the link and its a privated , boom the info is gone once and for all 
if reddit falls ,it takes a significant part of the whole ass internet with it , gonna effect everyone
13/06/2023, 10:16 am - +91 6366 682 139: Exactly. Reddit is also home to piracy, which is really important in some cases. It has really good collections of scene releases, pirate website megathreads and so on. If some abandonware is still available in the present era, it is partly due to redditors reviving the software and making it available.

And I get that they wanna remove competitor apps to increase ad revenue
But the protests
So much important information could potentially be lost
They should do it a lol more diplomatically
Copying Elon musk won't do any good

EDIT: About the protests, Reddit hasn't left redditors any other options. There was an AMA hosted by the owner of reddit, and his answers were plain unsatisfactory. He got soo many downvotes, but he awarded his posts and comments himself to negate it. 

Nah mate, Reddit ain't changing with such a person at its head <This message was edited>

20/06/2023, 12:10 am - +91 94495 71975: Both are used interchangeably in qns from what i have see🫠

so f(pi+) will be pi + pi²
and f(pi-) will be -pi + (-pi)²
20/06/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 89054 72730: its pi- not -pi
20/06/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 97408 01717: yeah so you'll just take positive and negative pi
20/06/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 94839 91979: It's periodic so right hand side of pi is same as lower limit

25/06/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 78998 03080: i think its some company cause they can't give a student so much liberty abt marks and details of other students
25/06/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 78998 03080: wats the prob. of us getting a welcome party clubed with juniors
25/06/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 85537 17575: Former student would work. Their marks wouldn’t be in the system
25/06/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 85537 17575: Almost but not quite exactly zero

25/06/2023, 7:24 pm - +91 87553 16048: Can students really maintain the codebase of a university?
25/06/2023, 7:26 pm - +91 91087 96229: I mean
It's not that hard
25/06/2023, 7:27 pm - +91 94495 71975: This message was deleted
25/06/2023, 7:44 pm - +91 87553 16048: If u say so
25/06/2023, 7:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: Like
25/06/2023, 7:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: Eventually they have to do it professionally eite
25/06/2023, 7:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: Rite*
25/06/2023, 7:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: So if u take like 5-10 competent students every year
And have them work on the codebase for the university
It's a win-win
25/06/2023, 7:46 pm - +91 91087 96229: Uni gets work done for free, and gets to showcase that their students only did it
Students get experience and get to improve their resume
25/06/2023, 7:46 pm - +91 91087 96229: And the students r incentivized to do as good of a job as they can both because it's _their_ work and bcoz the reputation of the uni they belong to is at stake kinda
25/06/2023, 7:47 pm - +91 91087 96229: Most people r retarded tho
Like if u r the kind of guy
who asks for past year papers on WhatsApp
Or copy other people's notes for lab without doing it on ur own
Then u will definitely mot be competent enough to do smthg like this
25/06/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 87553 16048: How big of a server would you need to handle like 4-5 thousand users?
25/06/2023, 7:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: Depends
25/06/2023, 7:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: Are they online all the time?
What kind of requests?
In case of pes they only need a cloud dB and other than that they could probly use some dumbass x86 SBC
25/06/2023, 7:53 pm - +91 87553 16048: Ig for a smal site like betterpes,u won't need that much work
25/06/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 91087 96229: Exactly raspberry pi will only do
25/06/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 87553 16048: But official site also has other stuffs like payments for fees and shit
25/06/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 87553 16048: So i don't think they will trust students in that
25/06/2023, 7:55 pm - +91 91087 96229: That they can build on their own
25/06/2023, 7:59 pm - +91 6361 790 234: then again, betterpes still hasn't reached the entirety of the campus

there's a good number that don't know about the discord server even
25/06/2023, 8:02 pm - +91 85537 17575: a decently large one, like a high-end gaming pc kind, to handle the traffic, and a very fast network card as well
25/06/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: Yeah make sure to include an rtx 4090
25/06/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 85537 17575: That’s if you actually care about performance, which pes does t
25/06/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 85537 17575: Not what I meant but ok
25/06/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: It needs to have an rtx 4090 and 64 gb ddr69 ram
25/06/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 85537 17575: I meant in terms of cpu
25/06/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: Otherwise u can't serve a few kilobytes of html
25/06/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 91087 96229: Oh and put liquid cooling also and use the latest AMD thread ripper
Otherwise the part where you server a couple kilobytes of css might fail
25/06/2023, 8:05 pm - +91 91087 96229: My dad is actually working on the nvidia rtx 6090 Ti he told me all this
25/06/2023, 8:05 pm - +91 85537 17575: And make sure to switch off the server just before the exams
25/06/2023, 8:05 pm - +91 85537 17575: So students can’t access it
25/06/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 86187 66851: Add the 7.2 MW PSU
25/06/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 85537 17575: TW*
25/06/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 96760 93705: Nah bring Linus to build the ultimate server
25/06/2023, 8:31 pm - +91 91087 96229: Torvalds or techtips?
25/06/2023, 8:46 pm - +91 85537 17575: Both
25/06/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 82395 18499: tech burner is enough
25/06/2023, 10:41 pm - +91 96760 93705: Bruh 💀

25/06/2023, 11:36 pm - +91 88675 28866: Well atleast it wasn't beebom
25/06/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 96760 93705: What? I didn't get the reference 😂 all i know is that his way of narration is annoying as fuck
25/06/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 96760 93705: Like man tries to hype even shitty small things
26/06/2023, 12:07 am - +91 82395 18499: Yeah 😂
26/06/2023, 7:47 am - +91 73389 36843: Its not difficult really
26/06/2023, 7:48 am - +91 73389 36843: Pes uses Microsoft azure from what I've seen which means they are likely using some off the shelf config. So its pretty accessible definitely not cheap for a single person to host but its a college so the cost is justified
26/06/2023, 7:49 am - +91 73389 36843: You can use an old computer at home and turn it into a home server. That's what I do to host an entire IRC bridge and some bots
26/06/2023, 7:51 am - +91 85537 17575: I thought they were using aws though?
26/06/2023, 7:52 am - +91 73389 36843: No I was working on one of their subdomains and it was using azure so likely they're using azure for all of it
26/06/2023, 7:52 am - +91 85537 17575: That makes sense
26/06/2023, 7:53 am - +91 73389 36843: Unless they have split it across providers which seems like a hassle
26/06/2023, 8:19 am - +91 93537 16080: IP lookup tools claim aws
26/06/2023, 8:19 am - +91 93537 16080: For pesuacademy
26/06/2023, 8:19 am - +91 73389 36843: Hm I guess it's azure for pes.edu only then
26/06/2023, 8:20 am - +91 73389 36843: Because the subdomain I was working for is of pes.edu
26/06/2023, 8:20 am - +91 93537 16080: Why are they using both providers 💀
26/06/2023, 8:20 am - +91 73389 36843: Yeah very PES-like
26/06/2023, 8:35 am - +91 82966 96682: no fucking way you guys are still going on about this
26/06/2023, 8:35 am - +91 88675 28866: Is it wrong to dream 😔

29/06/2023, 1:13 pm - +91 78928 44424: No. Got it from AV summary. 

It was for us to solve
29/06/2023, 1:14 pm - +91 6361 631 974: I got 40.5pi as answer somehow lmao
29/06/2023, 1:14 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Idk if what I did is correct or not
29/06/2023, 1:15 pm - +91 94495 71975: Is it to be solved by cylindrical coordinates system?
29/06/2023, 1:15 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Ye that's what
29/06/2023, 1:15 pm - +91 80882 73401: were the theta limits from 0 to 2*pi?
29/06/2023, 1:15 pm - +91 6361 631 974: That's what I took
29/06/2023, 1:15 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Cuz it's a paraboloid(?)
29/06/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Not sure tho
29/06/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 6361 631 974: That's my doubt
29/06/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 80882 73401: yeah even i think in the same way
29/06/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 6361 631 974: 162pi/4
29/06/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Is what I got
29/06/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 78928 44424: Yes
29/06/2023, 1:17 pm - +91 78928 44424: I got (243*pi)/2 ?

29/06/2023, 1:20 pm - +91 78928 44424: Mistake 😓
29/06/2023, 1:21 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Also how did u get r as 0 to 3
29/06/2023, 1:21 pm - +91 6361 631 974: They didn't say anything about r being 3 no?
29/06/2023, 1:21 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Z is 3
29/06/2023, 1:22 pm - +91 80882 73401: r cannot go negative
29/06/2023, 1:22 pm - +91 80882 73401: put z = 3 in x^2 + y^2 = 3z

29/06/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Lol
29/06/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 6361 631 974: U missed an r
29/06/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 80882 73401: yes
29/06/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 80882 73401: shouldnt z limits be r^2/3 to 3
29/06/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 80882 73401: ?
29/06/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 76187 12509: Oh including that one r, then??
29/06/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 76187 12509: Bro like starting point will be 0 na
29/06/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Oh ye fair u can do that, I took r = sqrt(3z)
29/06/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 6361 631 974: In the limits
29/06/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Without subbing value of z
29/06/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 99010 14919: It’s r cube
29/06/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 99010 14919: Not rsq
29/06/2023, 1:25 pm - +91 80882 73401: doesnt it start from the paraboloid boundary and ends at 3
29/06/2023, 1:26 pm - +91 6361 631 974: r²/3 is 3 only no lmao
29/06/2023, 1:27 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Cuz r = 3
29/06/2023, 1:27 pm - +91 72900 58727: does it matter if we take r^2/3 to 3, or can I take it as 3 to r^2/3
29/06/2023, 1:27 pm - +91 76187 12509: It matters bro
29/06/2023, 1:29 pm - +91 99010 14919: do we need to integrate it in order 

Like can we interchange the integrals
29/06/2023, 1:32 pm - +91 94839 91979: This is the right one but i think the limits of z is reverse, r^2 to 3 because it's basically a paraboloid if you plot it
29/06/2023, 1:33 pm - +91 94839 91979: You can't split it like that
29/06/2023, 1:37 pm - +91 97390 95035: I got 81 pi

29/06/2023, 6:50 pm - +91 73532 91375: how is L=1 ?
29/06/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 72900 58727: half range is defined is (0,l), no?
29/06/2023, 6:51 pm - +91 73532 91375: yea, in (0,1/2) L=1/2 no??

29/06/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 73532 91375: for (1/2, 1), L=1
29/06/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 73532 91375: L will change no for both integrals 🤔
29/06/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 90199 42460: For half range, you're assuming the other half is either odd or even
29/06/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 90199 42460: So you are expanding the function such that the interval become (0,L), eg (0,1/2) to (0,1)
29/06/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 94839 91979: No bro L = 1 for the entire thing, doesn't matter if the function splits there's only one L which is half of periodicity always

29/06/2023, 11:36 pm - +91 83107 58397: If you refer to the question, it's asking for the probability of the event that the student is good at maths, including P(0) wouldn't logically make sense as it would infer that neither of the students are good at math which is opposite of what we're asked to find
29/06/2023, 11:36 pm - +91 83107 58397: While it does exist in the sample space, it just doesn't have any correlation to the event

01/07/2023, 7:59 pm - +91 97418 00513: That our papers weren't saved

01/07/2023, 8:02 pm - +91 77188 25988: Actually I just checked and it seems everyone got the same 💀
01/07/2023, 8:02 pm - +91 93292 42883: thats better than them giving a striaght up 0
01/07/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 97418 00513: Still puts us at disadvantage
01/07/2023, 8:03 pm - +91 97418 00513: Like why TF did we prepare then

01/07/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 94834 59419: Either way we all fucked ✨
01/07/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: Actually, math is the only paper where marks ar given by the system
01/07/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 97418 00513: Coz it's the only subject that ain't theory
01/07/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 93292 42883: not the kinda fucked i wanted to be in college but ok

01/07/2023, 8:06 pm - +91 91130 56352: Btw is this only for maths or for other subjects as well
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: During isa
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Not a chance 😂
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 94834 59419: Only for math
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Best case scenario
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 6361 790 234: they coded it on a potato
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Write it again
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 77953 89834: Guys I asked my math teacher she’s like the Absent thingy will be fixed soon
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Different paper ofc
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Come on 18

01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 90082 75026: They probably put A coz they haven't finished correcting and uploading the marks then
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 97418 00513: Same lol. Same thing w assignment they told
01/07/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 93292 42883: so negative for what
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 73532 91375: man r u insane or what-

01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: Better than 0
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 94834 59419: But how long will they take mcqs to be corrected bro
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: Also
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: Why only maths 4
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 73532 91375: the fact that ur so excited to rewrite an exam
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: Why would they upload before correcting
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: Not like PES cares for deadlines
01/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 97418 00513: Remember sem 1?
01/07/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 97418 00513: To copy from you

01/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 97418 00513: It's both 20 and 0
01/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 89054 72730: How many credits do we have for this sem
01/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 94834 59419: I think 22?

01/07/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 82870 36683: Everyone or only those who were marked absent
01/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 97317 42338: Just q about our marks, for subjects like C and Mech, how many marks will our total isa marks be reduced to? 30 or 40?
01/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 77602 37280: 40
01/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 86185 16813: 40
01/07/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 97317 42338: For all subjects?
01/07/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 77602 37280: Yeah for all except constitution or EVS
01/07/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 73532 91375: i think every1
01/07/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 73532 91375: 40
01/07/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 97317 42338: Ah shit, C I've gotten 23/40💀
01/07/2023, 9:24 pm - +91 94495 71975: pretty sure they havent updated the algorithm or whatever to calc final isa marks  , it still does reduction to out of 7.5 and total isa out of 30 🤔
01/07/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 89518 92589: Yeah, I think so too
01/07/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 94834 59419: Wait doremaga said total isa marks out of 40 this sem?
01/07/2023, 9:28 pm - +91 94839 91979: Could anyone help out?
01/07/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 90199 42460: No clue where to start 💀
01/07/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 73532 91375: yes, javu told
01/07/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 94839 91979: Same, i mean i guess average is pretty easy cuz directly average vehicles multipled by price
01/07/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 94839 91979: But sd no idea
01/07/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 90199 42460: Yeah
01/07/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 73532 91375: they were pissed off coz of our last sem marks so they increased the isa weightage 💀
01/07/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 90199 42460: Maybe sd is also just root of variance × toll?
01/07/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 94834 59419: Haan it's 40 not 30 no?
01/07/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 97395 33665: shouldn't it be rt(variance)*toll??
01/07/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 94495 71975: yeah
01/07/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 73532 91375: last sem we had it 30 so the code of pesu academy was set acc to that, now that they increased it to 40, they didn't change the code ig
01/07/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 90199 42460: Makes sense
01/07/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 93537 16080: yep its root(variance)*toll most likely
01/07/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 93537 16080: only way it makes sense

01/07/2023, 10:36 pm - +91 90086 35374: Hmm
01/07/2023, 10:41 pm - +91 97418 00513: Damn isa 4 is out
01/07/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: RIP 20 marks 1/7/23 -  1/7/23
01/07/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 93292 42883: toppers cant relate
01/07/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 97418 00513: You got 20 no💀
01/07/2023, 10:49 pm - +91 93292 42883: sure
01/07/2023, 11:00 pm - +91 87553 16048: do need to draw all the plots for normal probability plots or anyone of them>

01/07/2023, 11:15 pm - +91 6362 204 078: Oh yeah sorry, forgot abt tht
01/07/2023, 11:16 pm - +91 6362 204 078: It's wrong then
01/07/2023, 11:16 pm - +91 80882 73401: Also given xy plane right
01/07/2023, 11:16 pm - +91 80882 73401: So theta will be between 0 and 90 degrees right
01/07/2023, 11:16 pm - +91 6362 649 645: are u sure the limits of theta are 0 to 2pi
01/07/2023, 11:17 pm - +91 6362 204 078: Tbh I'm not sure of that also, but this makes sense

01/07/2023, 11:35 pm - +91 76187 12509: Yep so theta is from -pi/2 to pi/2  right??
01/07/2023, 11:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah

02/07/2023, 10:52 am - +91 76187 12509: At last shud we again differentiate??
02/07/2023, 10:52 am - +91 80882 73401: Evaluation of log else is difficult
02/07/2023, 10:53 am - +91 76187 12509: We find Inverse of log(s+4/s-4) and then diff by t.. does this work
02/07/2023, 10:53 am - +91 80882 73401: Try once
02/07/2023, 10:54 am - +91 76187 12509: Bruv some sort of answer I got

02/07/2023, 11:09 am - +91 76187 12509: Yeah so we could diff
02/07/2023, 11:10 am - +91 80882 73401: then you could use properties of laplace and obtain f(t) and then differentiate f(t) to find the laplce
02/07/2023, 11:10 am - +91 80882 73401: *laplace

Sorry..
02/07/2023, 11:54 am - +91 94495 71975: probably cause the given qns has only cosine terms in it ?

02/07/2023, 11:57 am - +91 97418 00513: Ok guys, listen carefully. Each and every one of you have to do this. Just spoke to BMS sir,and since HOD didn't respond, y'all have to write a mail to vive chancellor saying 26 students got 0 in the assignment due to a technical glitch, and the HOD hasn't responded

This isn't just for me and Shreya, everyone has to mail him

Also DO NOT MENTION THAT BMS SIR HAS ASKED US TO DO THIS
02/07/2023, 11:57 am - +91 97395 33665: Mind sending written answer

02/07/2023, 3:15 pm - +91 88266 92108: How do we solve the second one??
02/07/2023, 3:16 pm - +91 85537 17575: Is there a function f(x) given? since the question is incomplete?
02/07/2023, 3:18 pm - +91 94495 71975: the function is just x for the first sum 
for the second sum no further info is provided
02/07/2023, 3:18 pm - +91 90199 42460: Replace that lhs x with f(x)
02/07/2023, 3:18 pm - +91 90199 42460: It's probably a printing error
02/07/2023, 3:18 pm - +91 90320 33391: yes indirectly there are saying f(x) = x defined in the interval 0,2
02/07/2023, 3:18 pm - +91 90199 42460: Then use Parsevals identity
02/07/2023, 3:19 pm - +91 94495 71975: correct , u can use it to deduce till pi^4/96
the sum after that is what im asking
02/07/2023, 3:21 pm - +91 79090 33467: For second one, differentiate F(s) and then take inverse both sides. After that denominator would be in form of completing the square,.further a2-b2 formula
02/07/2023, 3:47 pm - +91 73532 91375: F(x)=x
02/07/2023, 3:47 pm - +91 73532 91375: It's there in the series

02/07/2023, 5:55 pm - +91 73532 91375: Not sure tbh😕
02/07/2023, 5:55 pm - +91 94495 71975: the qn asked for convolution 
and it wont be a pleasant experience doing division 5 times 💀
02/07/2023, 5:56 pm - +91 94495 71975: cause u will have to integrate 5 times ig
02/07/2023, 5:56 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ohh yeah i didn't read the full question my bad, but i guess it won't be that difficult to integrate e^-3t 5 times right?
02/07/2023, 5:57 pm - +91 94839 91979: I just hate convolution 🥲

02/07/2023, 8:18 pm - +91 77602 37280: Divide it into 2 symmetrical parts
02/07/2023, 8:18 pm - +91 77602 37280: Take only the part which is one positive x side
02/07/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 94495 71975: no , but how are u plotting the graph with hand in exam
02/07/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 77602 37280: You can plot by taking 3 values
02/07/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 77602 37280: One is x=0
02/07/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 77602 37280: X=-ve

02/07/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 85537 17575: Can we take y=2-(x^2/y^3)
02/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 93537 16080: You dont need to plot
02/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 93537 16080: Just solve it algebraically
02/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 93537 16080: Take x as - root to + root
02/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 93537 16080: And y from 0 to 2
02/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 77602 37280: For plot there is 1  mark I think
02/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 93537 16080: Better to lose 1 mark than the whole question

02/07/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 93537 16080: But I have no clue if its right
02/07/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 90366 74925: rewrite as cos2t and thn use div by t thing twice
02/07/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 85537 17575: use L(t^n f(t)) = -d^n/dt^n(F(s)) form
02/07/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 94495 71975: i got 1/4 , didnt get the pi part , mind sharing the soln ?
02/07/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 85537 17575: And apply identity
02/07/2023, 8:28 pm - +91 76187 12509: How do we solve it?

02/07/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 93537 16080: Oh wait theres an error I think it should be 1/8pi
02/07/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 93537 16080: Yeah
02/07/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 93537 16080: So its right then

02/07/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 93537 16080: There has to be a pi term

02/07/2023, 8:44 pm - +91 93537 16080: And the 1/2pi goes on the other side
02/07/2023, 8:46 pm - +91 6363 529 889: Can anyone send the parseval theorem solutions for the self learning component?
02/07/2023, 8:46 pm - +91 97395 33665: Then pi/8
02/07/2023, 8:47 pm - +91 6362 204 078: its only 5th unit tho @916363529889
02/07/2023, 8:48 pm - +91 6363 529 889: Yeah but in the self study component some derivations are given and there arent any solution given in that pdf
02/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 81056 35154: its pi/2 only
02/07/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 81056 35154: integral 0 to inf sin^2t/t^2 is pi/2

02/07/2023, 10:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: Y'all should learn how to use the calculator. If you're in CS, that thing will do 80% of your work in the ESA if you know how to use it for stats as well as the linear algebra courses
02/07/2023, 10:48 pm - Aditeya Baral: It's got everything built in to calculate everything you need, super easy for ISAs too

02/07/2023, 11:20 pm - +91 78928 44424: Or you can plot x v/s the 3rd row values only
02/07/2023, 11:21 pm - +91 97317 42338: How

02/07/2023, 11:22 pm - +91 94495 71975: When using Laplace , if u make the s=0 , e^st term vanishes giving the reqd integral

I just remember the value of that integral , it can be used as a standard result pretty sure

03/07/2023, 12:01 am - +91 94495 71975: U multiply both eqns with a suitable linear factor to eliminate one of the functions and solve 
Then take inverse
03/07/2023, 12:02 am - +91 94495 71975: Like in this , multiply eq 1 with s+1 , eq 2 with s-1 
Then the Y fn coeff become same and both eqn can be subtracted
03/07/2023, 12:03 am - +91 94495 71975: Similarly find a suitable factor so both eqn X fn coeff become same
03/07/2023, 12:03 am - +91 90368 07007: Ohh.. k. Thanks 

2nd one?

03/07/2023, 12:07 am - +91 6361 790 234: don't wanna ask you to risk it also but

the chances that we get simultaneous de with Laplace is close to 0.

they have to cover Laplace, inverse and regular de solving also
03/07/2023, 12:08 am - +91 90199 42460: a) is a property
03/07/2023, 12:08 am - +91 6361 790 234: previous year papers had laplace and inverse separately
03/07/2023, 12:08 am - +91 6361 790 234: this is the chebyshev inequality, I think?
03/07/2023, 12:08 am - +91 94495 71975: I feel DE will be from Fourier 💀💀💀
03/07/2023, 12:09 am - +91 90199 42460: Where P[(x-mu)>=k × Sigma] = 1/k²

03/07/2023, 12:09 am - +91 90368 07007: Bro the solution in the pdf will take at least 2 hrs 59 mins
03/07/2023, 12:09 am - +91 78928 44424: We have de from fourier?

03/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 78928 44424: Could you send a sample question if you have(solved)
03/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 6361 790 234: hey, is the formula > or <
03/07/2023, 12:12 am - +91 94495 71975: I didn't solve , our lady just discussed on board , nor did find any qns in pyqs so yeah
03/07/2023, 12:12 am - +91 90199 42460: The inequality if for >=
03/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 90199 42460: So for <, you can use 1- that probability ig
03/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 6361 790 234: yeah
03/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 94495 71975: Oh it's the 68-95-99.7 thing but generalised
03/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 6361 790 234: yep, these will mostly be asked for normal distribution
03/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 6361 790 234: because the values here are related to your z score
03/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 6361 790 234: same logic as Laplace, apply the transform on both ends
03/07/2023, 12:16 am - +91 97395 33665: Somebody mind explaining what is chebyshev theorm.
03/07/2023, 12:16 am - +91 6361 790 234: sure.

03/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 6361 790 234: the actual definition is:

no more than 1/kth of the distributions values can be k or more standard deviations away from the mean
03/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 6361 790 234: its a little crazy but, try remembering :P
03/07/2023, 12:23 am - +91 94495 71975: Bro esa and all this shit they won't ask , it's gonna be worth not more than 2 marks
03/07/2023, 12:23 am - +91 6361 790 234: so suppose k is 3

then only 33% of the values in the distribution are away from the mean by 3 standard deviations or more
03/07/2023, 12:23 am - +91 6361 790 234: inb4 these cunts ask normal probability plot
03/07/2023, 12:24 am - +91 6361 790 234: who knows💀
03/07/2023, 12:25 am - +91 94495 71975: Hell nah 💀💀💀
03/07/2023, 1:15 am - Aditeya Baral: Also in a normal distribution, the split of values is 34% within the first SD, 14% between first and second, and 2% beyond the 3rd. 34-14-2 is a common statistical distribution that's used :)
03/07/2023, 1:15 am - Aditeya Baral: That's where you get the 1/k value distribution which you mentioned

03/07/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 74112 64188: Dear Students
It has been observed that some students try to cheat during the examination process using unfair means.

To be fair to the students who are taking the examinations seriously, it has been mandated by the University to put in place a system of ensuring that students do not enter the examination halls with unacceptable materials.

 *Starting tomorrow, students are required to assemble near the PESU52 area from the canteen side for checking students and ensuring that they do not carry any unacceptable material to the assessment center.* 

Students have to ensure that they put all their belongings - jackets, cell phones, ear pods, and any other electronic device with a communication facility in their bags and empty their pockets of any chits etc.

Students can carry only their pens, pencils, erasers and acceptable calculators along with their hall tickets into the assessment rooms.

Once the process is  completed the authorised personnel would fix a date stamp on the reverse of the hall tickets. No student will be allowed inside the assessment room without this stamping.

All students are advised to strictly follow this process to ensure a fair and free evaluation.
Best wishes

05/07/2023, 11:51 pm - +91 90083 45926: From my understanding when you split diagram into two parts ab and bc,
Force by a is 100 newtons
Force by  b on diagram ab is 150-50= 100
Force by b on diagram bc is
50+100 =150  
So 50 newton is being considered

06/07/2023, 12:41 pm - +91 86188 49484: any idea about the types of subjects we can expect for sem 3 ?
06/07/2023, 12:41 pm - Aditeya Baral: Each sem is either 22 or 24 credits
06/07/2023, 12:42 pm - Aditeya Baral: Depends on your branch
06/07/2023, 12:42 pm - +91 86188 49484: cse
06/07/2023, 12:43 pm - +91 75400 90995: 22
06/07/2023, 12:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: Data Structures, Statistics, computer organization,
06/07/2023, 12:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: Apart from that there are 2 more, don't remember anymore lol
06/07/2023, 12:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: And there's a special topic you can choose
06/07/2023, 12:44 pm - +91 86188 49484: oh okay. thnx
06/07/2023, 12:53 pm - +91 6361 790 234: this will add to the existing credits correct?
06/07/2023, 12:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup
06/07/2023, 12:54 pm - +91 86188 49484: special topics same as minors ?
06/07/2023, 12:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: No

06/07/2023, 12:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ah that catastrophe 💀
06/07/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 73389 36843: Lol
06/07/2023, 12:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: I mean you _have_ to take it up
06/07/2023, 12:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: So you don't have a choice. You only get to select the course
06/07/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 6361 790 234: oh wait, a special topic is compulsory?
06/07/2023, 12:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup, it's 2 credits
06/07/2023, 12:56 pm - +91 6361 790 234: so thats 5 subjects+special topic
06/07/2023, 12:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup. It'll be like that for 3rd, 4th, 5th sem (unless they change anything)
06/07/2023, 12:56 pm - +91 6361 790 234: then the sem is for 24 credits, is that how it is?
06/07/2023, 12:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: 6th sem is 5 courses + capstone
06/07/2023, 12:56 pm - +91 6361 790 234: ah I see
06/07/2023, 12:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah
06/07/2023, 12:57 pm - +91 6361 790 234: thats nice, a chance at redeeming trash grades I suppose
06/07/2023, 12:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: I think the current final year batch was experimented with. So theirs is a bit different. They cancelled special topics for them and moved them all to sem 7. But they reverted the change for the batch after that
06/07/2023, 12:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: But ideally it should remain like this
06/07/2023, 12:57 pm - +91 6361 790 234: oh okay, that sounds a bit taxing
06/07/2023, 12:58 pm - +91 6361 790 234: now that they've come up with this new isa system, feels like you have some time atleast
06/07/2023, 12:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: The special topic options remain mostly the same. You can check on PES media for the list of courses offered
06/07/2023, 12:58 pm - +91 6361 790 234: thank you so much
06/07/2023, 12:59 pm - +91 6361 790 234: as for the split of isa and assignment, is it 40+10 for you guys too?
06/07/2023, 1:07 pm - +91 94495 71975: What's capstone
06/07/2023, 1:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: It was for us, but it can depend on the course
06/07/2023, 1:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: You will have assignments + project in some courses
06/07/2023, 1:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: So depending on that it will scale
06/07/2023, 1:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Final year project

08/07/2023, 4:18 pm - +91 94495 71975: ye
08/07/2023, 4:19 pm - +91 82968 47111: I don’t think so, ig the answer is option 1. Bloch function is similar to this equation.
08/07/2023, 4:22 pm - +91 6363 228 627: iii) is acceptable right?
08/07/2023, 4:22 pm - +91 73532 91375: Someone plz send this😭😭

08/07/2023, 4:22 pm - +91 6363 426 538: The bloch function has e^(ikx)
08/07/2023, 4:23 pm - +91 6363 426 538: But (i) doesnot
08/07/2023, 4:24 pm - +91 82968 47111: Well in Bloch function, ‘ik’ is a constant. Similarly, in the given question, ‘a’ is a constant too. So you’ll get e^ax instead of e^ikx
08/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 94495 71975: 💀what 
e^ikx is a periodic function 
e^ax is an exponential function
08/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 82968 47111: Hmmm that makes sense too. Idk tho, it just seems like option 1 is correct to me

09/07/2023, 7:21 pm - +91 97390 95035: no ik that its Compton shift but how to find that angle
09/07/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 97395 33665: Do it the same way but change the mass to mass of electrons
09/07/2023, 7:23 pm - +91 97390 95035: so mass of electron instead of m knot?

09/07/2023, 10:36 pm - +91 6363 228 627: how to do?
09/07/2023, 10:38 pm - +91 97395 33665: E = (h^2k^2/8pim)-v0
09/07/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 99010 14919: should it be pi^2 in the denominator
09/07/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 99010 14919: also k=h/root(2m(E-Vo)) in this case right

09/07/2023, 10:56 pm - +91 94839 91979: Why is it that and not -a/4 and a/4, why by default the  well is from 0 to L and not -a/2 to a/2?
09/07/2023, 10:57 pm - +91 6362 204 078: confined means finite so 0 to L
09/07/2023, 10:59 pm - +91 94839 91979: Hmm kk thanks
09/07/2023, 11:00 pm - +91 6361 790 234: these questions are asked with the convention of 0 to L only but even if you took it from the -x and +x it wont exactly make a massive difference.

11/07/2023, 11:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: Because you all keep asking:

1. http://library.pes.edu/opac/Search.aspx
2. In the title put the course code without the year. So if it is UE22MA101, put only MA101. Click search.
3. Find any paper you like, click download
4. It might ask you to login. To login, use any PRN from the 2023 outgoing or before batches. You can use the PRN as PES120YYXXXXX. For example, you can use PES1201800301. The password for anyone from these batches is "pesit". If the password does not work, it means they have changed it. Simply try with another PRN until it works.
11/07/2023, 11:11 pm - +91 89712 54123: it works with the course name and your regular srn and password as well im prettu sure
11/07/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 94495 71975: Cause the z is always z-phase
U need to find Z-line , then u can do v-line/z-line = i-line 
🤔
11/07/2023, 11:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Works with the course name, but then you will get all the papers from _that_ year. Removing the "UEXX" part will return all papers for that course
11/07/2023, 11:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: And yeah should work with SRN and password
11/07/2023, 11:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: But if it doesn't you can always use the old batches' accounts
11/07/2023, 11:16 pm - +91 89712 54123: Name as in like 'Elements of Electrical Engineering'
11/07/2023, 11:17 pm - +91 89712 54123: but yeah the number is easier

12/07/2023, 5:12 pm - +91 89712 54123: EEE
12/07/2023, 5:21 pm - +91 73532 91375: we dont know whether the circuit is an RC or RL circuit
12/07/2023, 5:21 pm - +91 73532 91375: better to find all I feel 😅
12/07/2023, 5:22 pm - +91 72900 58727: i mean initially yeah, but it's of the form R+jXl, so it's gonna be RL no?
12/07/2023, 5:23 pm - +91 72900 58727: You're not gonna get an C
12/07/2023, 5:23 pm - +91 73532 91375: ohf, didn't see that
12/07/2023, 5:23 pm - +91 73532 91375: its RL circuit only 😅
12/07/2023, 5:25 pm - +91 96061 40554: its RC no because its in parallel, if it were in series it would be RL
12/07/2023, 5:26 pm - +91 72900 58727: no cuz it's Z they gave no? not Y
12/07/2023, 5:27 pm - +91 96061 40554: huh
12/07/2023, 5:28 pm - +91 72900 58727: they've given you impedance, not admittance...when you convert it to admittance, you'll get something of the form G-jBl
12/07/2023, 5:28 pm - +91 89054 72730: You find Y by reciprocating, it'll come in G-jBL format

12/07/2023, 9:38 pm - +91 96061 40554: after finding p=4 i think you should find Ns again, which will be 1500. Then taking N =1440 you get slip as 4%
12/07/2023, 9:40 pm - +91 73532 91375: how to determine which is Ns and which is N?
12/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 96061 40554: with p = 4 or a whole number you cant get N as 1440, so then you try again and get Ns as 1500
12/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 96061 40554: there was something like that mentioned in the slides
12/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 73532 91375: ohh, will check it out 👍
12/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah 1440 is N, you have to use the condition that s < 1 so closest Ns possible with N=1440 is 1500 then find P
12/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 73532 91375: so s should always be greater than 1%?
12/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 94839 91979: S should be < 100%
12/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 96061 40554: they had said s<5% usually
12/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ahh okay sorry then this
12/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 94839 91979: And Ns should be  a divisor of 6000 as 120×50 is 6000, 1500 satisfies both conditions
12/07/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 94495 71975: Yk u are fucked when u get slip greater than 100%

12/07/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 70194 70904: 25% of each current is the answer

12/07/2023, 11:48 pm - +91 75400 90995: how?
12/07/2023, 11:48 pm - +91 6360 508 139: Standstill means N is 0
12/07/2023, 11:49 pm - +91 6360 508 139: So s = Ns/Ns, so slip is 1
12/07/2023, 11:51 pm - +91 73532 91375: In this 
Do we have to assume that frequency of motor is 50?
12/07/2023, 11:51 pm - +91 77188 25988: oh thanks
12/07/2023, 11:52 pm - +91 97395 33665: You have to use alternator to find out frequency
12/07/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 77188 25988: No. We calculate frequency of the alternator from the given data and equate it to the motor
12/07/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: Which will come out to be 50 anyways
12/07/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 73532 91375: So we have to take Ns=1000

++a means change then use

10 * 12

15/07/2023, 4:09 pm - +91 83103 70225: Just remember a++ is post increment and ++a is pre increament,later logic you can apply

15/07/2023, 4:09 pm - +91 82965 44577: because a++ is first it makes 10 11 and then its preincrementt so its 12
15/07/2023, 4:09 pm - +91 90199 42460: 2nd line should be 132 right?
15/07/2023, 4:10 pm - +91 97395 33665: should be but answer is showing 144
15/07/2023, 4:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: First it increases to 11 then 12?
15/07/2023, 4:12 pm - +91 97418 00513: So 11*12
15/07/2023, 4:14 pm - +91 90199 42460: Fuck it, "unspecified behaviour"

15/07/2023, 4:28 pm - Aditeya Baral: As an example, at work we use Scala, which uses functional programming at its core. Which means we avoid loops or if statements, and everything is a map, filter and reduce. But in some places, replacing a loop or if block becomes extremely complex to read with a functional logic, and there we resort to using a normal if

15/07/2023, 4:32 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yea you get an idea now how much ik of programming
15/07/2023, 4:40 pm - +91 96320 07839: i believe the increment operator is compiler dependent
so a few fuck ups here and there can be expected
15/07/2023, 4:41 pm - +91 94495 71975: im gonna write compiler dependent on all output qns on monday atp
15/07/2023, 4:41 pm - +91 73389 36843: Real branchless? 😱 twitter stack be like
15/07/2023, 4:47 pm - +91 99456 67559: anyone has 2022 paper?

15/07/2023, 5:43 pm - +91 97418 00513: Theory
15/07/2023, 5:45 pm - +91 89054 72730: 50% is concept based

15/07/2023, 5:45 pm - +91 97418 00513: So 50 marks theory?!

15/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 89054 72730: Everything
15/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 89054 72730: Except writing programs
15/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 82965 44577: i think there will be like 1 program to write per unit
15/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 82965 44577: for 6 marks
15/07/2023, 5:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: Rest 14?
15/07/2023, 5:48 pm - +91 82965 44577: predict the output or theory

15/07/2023, 6:28 pm - +91 97418 00513: So should I do these or not
15/07/2023, 6:30 pm - +91 90366 74925: Idk 🤷‍♂️ Depends on ur prep , i am just focusing on pyqs, aint no way i can make time for all that
15/07/2023, 6:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: Are u prepared we'll?

15/07/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 94839 91979: Yeah but this is what you logically shud get
15/07/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 97395 33665: i complied them one my one. he complied them ogether
15/07/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 94495 71975: no , cause original had outputs for running each individually
15/07/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 99456 67559: Ah then makes sense
15/07/2023, 6:52 pm - +91 94839 91979: Ahhh okay that makes sense
15/07/2023, 6:56 pm - +91 97418 00513: Where u guys practicing programs from

15/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 96061 40554: is gdb coming?
15/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 91087 96229: Pov:
Ur employer asks u to debug a program
But u inform him that it was in the optional section of the exam so u didn't study it
15/07/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 96061 40554: real
15/07/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 97406 94534: that didnt answer his question but ok]
15/07/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 96061 40554: so it isnt then i assume
15/07/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 91087 96229: It's there in the portions

16/07/2023, 12:46 am - +91 6361 790 234: other colleges have it mad easy, but by the end of this sem, even as an average student you'll be far more capable compared to someone who was let off easy
16/07/2023, 1:27 am - +91 94495 71975: 🥹👍
Sahi h vro
16/07/2023, 2:23 am - +91 83103 70225: Life in other vtu colleges is damn easy,they have C programming theory,like wtf is theory,
16/07/2023, 6:45 am - +91 97418 00513: Leave that, Manipal Bangalore has English for fucks sake

16/07/2023, 9:18 am - +91 95084 21687: There are 7 characters
16/07/2023, 9:19 am - +91 89054 72730: What about the null character
16/07/2023, 9:19 am - +91 95084 21687: But while printing the compiler encounters \0 , which terminates the print function at atma\
16/07/2023, 9:20 am - +91 89054 72730: So shouldn't the size be six then
16/07/2023, 9:21 am - +91 95084 21687: Nope. sizeof() is an operator
16/07/2023, 9:21 am - +91 95084 21687: Not a function
16/07/2023, 9:21 am - +91 95084 21687: printf() is and function, strlen() is s function
16/07/2023, 9:22 am - +91 89054 72730: Huh?
16/07/2023, 9:23 am - +91 78928 44424: In each case the statements in the brackets get evaluated first, then the others,  so the outputs will be like that
16/07/2023, 9:24 am - +91 95084 21687: Idk how but it works differently
16/07/2023, 9:25 am - +91 6362 844 543: but why does 2nd and 3rd expressions give different answers?
16/07/2023, 9:25 am - +91 6362 844 543: If I am evaluating what's inside first, shouldn't both give me 0 20 20
16/07/2023, 9:27 am - +91 78928 44424: No, in the second one it is a*=c which is equal to a =  a*c

After this, a becomes 0
16/07/2023, 9:27 am - +91 80764 27750: 'a' 't' 'm' 'a' '\' '0' '\0'
Total 7 characters
16/07/2023, 9:29 am - +91 6362 844 543: So does third, 
Why is a substituted as 10 in the second case but 0 in third case
16/07/2023, 9:55 am - +91 97418 00513: Ykw? We won't. Both students will end up working a  3 LPA Job in a mass recruiting company like Infosys, and the only difference will be the MIT student will get laid and get to keep his hair for the course, whole PES students enter their adulthood as virgins and bald. The Manipal student would kick himself for enjoying his college life, while the PES student would kick himself for not having a college life
16/07/2023, 9:56 am - Aditeya Baral: Mid life crisis at 18 years old eh
16/07/2023, 9:57 am - Aditeya Baral: Also, what the dude saying is actually true. Shit on PES all you want but their syllabus and projects over the 4 years guarantee that you end up in a better state than most other colleges
16/07/2023, 9:57 am - +91 93537 16080: Dude check the placement stats
16/07/2023, 9:57 am - +91 82965 44577: join the real world course then
16/07/2023, 9:57 am - Aditeya Baral: You should see the stuff other colleges pass off as "project work". Yes it's super unorganised with us and 10x more stressful but at the end of the day you skills you pick up via these projects and other opportunities is far better here.
16/07/2023, 9:58 am - +91 97418 00513: The stats are skewed
16/07/2023, 9:58 am - +91 93537 16080: Also the syllabus is actually good, but I hate the braindead questions they ask which is almost always horrible programming practice
16/07/2023, 9:58 am - +91 97418 00513: The 3-4 60 LPA offers increase the average
16/07/2023, 9:58 am - +91 93537 16080: Median is where its ar bro
16/07/2023, 9:58 am - Aditeya Baral: While other colleges barely have projects in some courses, here courses like Big Data will make you actually implement small scale Big Data pipelines for projects.
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - Aditeya Baral: Yes, it's good. If only the faculty was the same lmao
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - +91 97418 00513: I was talking about Biotechnology 💀
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - +91 93537 16080: I wish the actual exam was like the submit questions we got
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - +91 93537 16080: Sublit*
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - +91 93537 16080: It would be so much better
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - +91 97418 00513: We have no option but to make a run for it and go abroad
16/07/2023, 9:59 am - Aditeya Baral: PES does a lot of things wrong but full credit to the few things it gets right tbh <This message was edited>
16/07/2023, 10:00 am - +91 6361 790 234: but then again 3-4 placements won't alter what speaks for 1000+ people na bro
16/07/2023, 10:00 am - +91 6361 790 234: its not a major skew
16/07/2023, 10:00 am - +91 97418 00513: Biotechnology sir 😭
16/07/2023, 10:01 am - +91 6361 790 234: arrey MS bhai, MS💪
16/07/2023, 10:01 am - +91 93537 16080: Just check the median. Its more indicative of actual placements anyway
16/07/2023, 10:01 am - +91 6361 790 234: yeah, it does get better year by year I feel
16/07/2023, 10:02 am - +91 97418 00513: It's not 9 LPA median for us lol, no one will give a research job to a Btech student who spent his freshman year doing Electrical and mechanical and his last year doing a project based on his second and third year knowledge
16/07/2023, 10:02 am - +91 93537 16080: Apparently, they are 😂😂😂
16/07/2023, 10:02 am - Aditeya Baral: Unfortunately not in biotech
16/07/2023, 10:03 am - Aditeya Baral: Tbh there are no biotech jobs in India after undergrad. If you're trying to do something in this field, you need a Masters
16/07/2023, 10:03 am - +91 97418 00513: It's a shame how Indian colleges won't capitalise on the rising BT field
16/07/2023, 10:04 am - Aditeya Baral: Ngl you're probably one of the last BT batches at PES
16/07/2023, 10:04 am - +91 97418 00513: It grew by 300% this year, but colleges refuse to even increase seats
16/07/2023, 10:04 am - +91 97418 00513: Actually no. Unlike mech n civil, BT demand is increasing. It used to be 40 seats 3 years ago and it's 60 now
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - Aditeya Baral: Demand might be increasing but we're talking about PESU
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - Aditeya Baral: They care only about CS
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - +91 97418 00513: The cut off when we entered was 4300

16/07/2023, 10:05 am - Aditeya Baral: They can remove you
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - +91 97418 00513: Don't wanna make an investment
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - +91 79750 80168: Pes college of aiml🙏
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - Aditeya Baral: Right now AIML is what is earning the big bucks for them
16/07/2023, 10:05 am - +91 97418 00513: Removing mech is fine
16/07/2023, 10:06 am - Aditeya Baral: They're even doing a shitshow with electives in non AIML specialisations by including ML topics in them
16/07/2023, 10:06 am - +91 97418 00513: They'd kick themselves in 15-20 years if they Remove BT
16/07/2023, 10:06 am - +91 93537 16080: Almost every single hack is something related to ai 😔
16/07/2023, 10:06 am - +91 79750 80168: Unironically true ece hackathon most projects were ml💀
16/07/2023, 10:07 am - Aditeya Baral: And for a college that pays so much attention to AIML
16/07/2023, 10:07 am - Aditeya Baral: Except maybe 2-3 profs nobody is qualified enough to teach it
16/07/2023, 10:07 am - +91 82870 36683: 💯
16/07/2023, 10:07 am - +91 97418 00513: I mean,. they're giving us classes in GJB,.which is massive. We got AC n shit now
16/07/2023, 10:08 am - +91 82965 44577: biotech aah?
16/07/2023, 10:08 am - Aditeya Baral: Ooh fancy

16/07/2023, 10:09 am - Aditeya Baral: At this rate they'll convert the specialisation into a branch
16/07/2023, 10:10 am - Aditeya Baral: As it is the ML research community is getting so diluted in quality day by day
16/07/2023, 10:10 am - Aditeya Baral: On top of that Uni's in India are nicely taking advantage of the hype
16/07/2023, 10:12 am - +91 97418 00513: BT will be a Shitshow tho. We'll b beside LLB mfs and they're chappri fr
16/07/2023, 10:13 am - Aditeya Baral: It's fine, you seem like you know what you want to do
16/07/2023, 10:14 am - Aditeya Baral: You'll figure it out

but even after i declare int week and check for individual values it works normally

16/07/2023, 11:23 am - +91 93537 16080: Dude when I run it it works perfectly
16/07/2023, 11:24 am - +91 89054 72730: -2*
16/07/2023, 11:26 am - +91 83107 58397: the recursive loop takes these values in total
16/07/2023, 11:26 am - +91 83107 58397: 12 10

16/07/2023, 11:26 am - +91 93537 16080: Trace it
16/07/2023, 11:26 am - +91 83107 58397: return of n2 in the end
16/07/2023, 11:26 am - +91 93537 16080: You get a pattern
16/07/2023, 11:27 am - +91 89054 72730: Why is the 3rd value of n1 is 9
16/07/2023, 11:28 am - +91 83107 58397: function takes n1 values as n2-2
16/07/2023, 11:28 am - +91 89054 72730: Ohh
16/07/2023, 11:28 am - +91 93537 16080: 11-2
16/07/2023, 11:28 am - +91 89054 72730: Okok
16/07/2023, 11:43 am - +91 91087 96229: Not really
Pes hasn't really done well in anything other than cybersec and placements
Cybersec also becoz students have a background already not coz pes did anything
Placements r also getting worse
16/07/2023, 11:43 am - +91 91087 96229: Pes doesn't have any labs or facilities
I've talked to Jawahar he has confirmed this
They r trying to transition from an engineering college to an AIML/CSE college
16/07/2023, 11:44 am - +91 91087 96229: The labs r getting worse
16/07/2023, 11:45 am - +91 91087 96229: Manipal, VIT atleast make it into rover design and other mechatronics
16/07/2023, 11:45 am - +91 91087 96229: Mechatronics competitions*
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: Never said that labs and facilities are nice
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - +91 91087 96229: Yall r ignoring the fact that the college shouldn't make u do smthg
It should enable u
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - +91 91087 96229: Other colleges enable u
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: I'm the first to complain that the research labs are non functional
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - +91 91087 96229: It's ur choice to do well or not
Pes just forces u
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: Tbh at the end of the day you need to work hard whether you're at IIT or PES
16/07/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: They are non existent at this point xD
16/07/2023, 11:47 am - +91 91087 96229: Yeah
But other colleges enable hardworking people a lot more
Pes enables average people a little more
16/07/2023, 11:47 am - Aditeya Baral: But I'm talking only from the syllabus and the projects that are part of the syllabus
16/07/2023, 11:47 am - +91 91087 96229: Tbh I would rather take the first one
16/07/2023, 11:47 am - Aditeya Baral: I'm not comparing other parameters
16/07/2023, 11:47 am - +91 91087 96229: Yeah so that's what
Why force everyone to learn to such a High degree
16/07/2023, 11:48 am - Aditeya Baral: Comparing other parameters is baseless because the other parameters don't even exist for us
16/07/2023, 11:48 am - +91 86188 49484: Yeah, PES would do well, it it were to become more of a iiit like thing
16/07/2023, 11:48 am - +91 91087 96229: They try so hard and use so much force to make some dumbfuck get a good job that they forget that there is a dude who is genuinely passionate about engineering and needs resources
16/07/2023, 11:49 am - Aditeya Baral: See, PES has major flaws. I'm not denying that. I have stopped recommending PES to people
16/07/2023, 11:50 am - Aditeya Baral: But there are a few things at PES that are in the right direction
16/07/2023, 11:50 am - Aditeya Baral: They're not perfect, but they're atleast trying to be right
16/07/2023, 11:50 am - Aditeya Baral: Placements are good, and I'm not sure what do you mean by getting worse year by year when until the current batch it's only gotten better
16/07/2023, 11:51 am - Aditeya Baral: The current 2024 batch is facing problems because of the job market
16/07/2023, 11:51 am - Aditeya Baral: The syllabus is good, not updated in the most accurate sense but just for formality. But still, better than most other colleges
16/07/2023, 11:52 am - Aditeya Baral: And atleast in CS, I can vouch for the fact that some of the projects you'll end up working on here are far better than what your potential colleagues from other colleges would have worked on.
16/07/2023, 11:53 am - Aditeya Baral: Yes it's stressful, facilities are non existent, opportunities are scarce, and I'll be the first to shit on them for this. But there are things that PES does right
16/07/2023, 11:53 am - Aditeya Baral: Does it save PES from criticism? Absolutely not
16/07/2023, 11:53 am - Aditeya Baral: But give credit where due
16/07/2023, 11:53 am - +91 81056 35154: the cons outweigh the few good things pes has which are not exactly good but sure
16/07/2023, 11:54 am - Aditeya Baral: I agree, that's why I don't recommend PES
16/07/2023, 11:54 am - Aditeya Baral: The cons outweigh the pros by a significant margin
16/07/2023, 11:54 am - Aditeya Baral: And thing is, we saw these signs when I was in 2nd year
16/07/2023, 11:54 am - Aditeya Baral: Back then we thought eh it's a bad phase (cause COVID), it'll pass
16/07/2023, 11:54 am - +91 81056 35154: the funding pes gets is the same as a management fees
16/07/2023, 11:54 am - +91 81056 35154: its a big joke
16/07/2023, 11:55 am - Aditeya Baral: But honestly things aren't getting better at all
16/07/2023, 11:55 am - Aditeya Baral: With the recent news of CORI being shut down, God knows which research labs are actually left
16/07/2023, 11:56 am - +91 83109 86426: Bro is using Vim🫡
16/07/2023, 12:21 pm - +91 75400 90995: PES moments r always joke

16/07/2023, 1:20 pm - +91 94495 71975: atoi is used in that strtok thing
16/07/2023, 1:44 pm - +91 97395 33665: wdym. its just a variable name
16/07/2023, 1:44 pm - +91 97395 33665: it is there in out syllabus.
16/07/2023, 1:45 pm - +91 89054 72730: Yeahh <This message was edited>
16/07/2023, 1:45 pm - +91 91108 81825: Nah it’s a function
16/07/2023, 1:45 pm - +91 94495 71975: argv is for variable length arguments

16/07/2023, 2:03 pm - +91 82968 47111: i] c = 5
ii] c = 6
16/07/2023, 2:04 pm - +91 78925 68180: i)c:5
ii) infinite loop
16/07/2023, 2:04 pm - +91 89054 72730: for ii) it should be an infinte loop no?
16/07/2023, 2:05 pm - +91 82968 47111: Well I’m not sure actually, I’ll give it a try
16/07/2023, 2:05 pm - +91 94495 71975: what does the 3rd sub question even mean 🤔
16/07/2023, 2:07 pm - +91 97395 33665: They never said the second condition is outside for loop na??
16/07/2023, 2:08 pm - +91 82968 47111: Yeah you’re right
16/07/2023, 2:09 pm - +91 94495 71975: if there is no {} bracket , only the immediate next statement is inside the given loop
rest are outside
16/07/2023, 2:09 pm - +91 94495 71975: so print is outside the loop
16/07/2023, 2:12 pm - +91 82968 47111: Ig it means what ‘c’ represents. Like in this case, it is used to count the number of iterations.
16/07/2023, 2:13 pm - +91 94495 71975: ahh , this subject is breaking my head 🥲
16/07/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 82968 47111: I agree. “Predict the output” questions are getting out of hand rn :(

16/07/2023, 5:13 pm - +91 91087 96229: sir
u can use neovim with any distro
16/07/2023, 5:14 pm - +91 91087 96229: the config file determines how the editor looks
16/07/2023, 5:15 pm - +91 73389 36843: Speaking of

16/07/2023, 5:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: Pov:
Ur employer asks u to store data I'm csv format
But u inform him that it was in the optional section of the exam so u didn't study it
16/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 70509 90365: you it's in optional section???
16/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 70509 90365: so*
16/07/2023, 5:46 pm - +91 94495 71975: everything is in the optional section with the right attitude
16/07/2023, 5:48 pm - +91 99028 55112: Prolly gdb is there. Question on this was asked last year.
16/07/2023, 5:49 pm - +91 70509 90365: thankyou bhai

16/07/2023, 6:03 pm - +91 96866 30410: Did anyone understand what does #pragma do??
16/07/2023, 6:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Its a directive, you can use it in a lot of ways. From calling functions before and after main() or setting up warnings settings
16/07/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 73532 91375: U still remember what u learnt in 1st year🫡
16/07/2023, 6:32 pm - Aditeya Baral: You'll end up using C till atleast 3rd year
16/07/2023, 6:32 pm - Aditeya Baral: So you might want to learn it properly xD
16/07/2023, 6:33 pm - +91 73532 91375: All branches ah?
Asking for a friend
16/07/2023, 6:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: A lot of people struggle with DSA and DAA coursework because they learn it only at a surface level in sem 2, so when things actually get complex it goes all downhill
16/07/2023, 6:33 pm - Aditeya Baral: CS and ECE, I know use C
Rest no clue
16/07/2023, 6:34 pm - Aditeya Baral: I've seen a lot of people having to re-learn concepts because they did just enough to scrape though the ESA
16/07/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: <Media omitted>
16/07/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 97418 00513: Do*
16/07/2023, 7:11 pm - +91 94495 71975: it makes it so that scanf continues to take input until the new line character is reached
16/07/2023, 7:12 pm - +91 82965 44577: taken in input till user doenst go press enter
16/07/2023, 7:13 pm - +91 97418 00513: So basically a sentence
16/07/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 89042 32230: scanf usually terminates at the first white space it encounters.
16/07/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 94897 14872: Yes sort of
16/07/2023, 7:20 pm - +91 6363 529 889: What does '?' operator does?
16/07/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 6366 682 139: ```?``` and ```:``` are together the ternary operator
16/07/2023, 7:22 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Syntax:
```condition ? true-value : false-value```
16/07/2023, 7:23 pm - +91 6363 529 889: ok Thanks

16/07/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 89054 72730: Why
16/07/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 89042 32230: 15 aayega na?
16/07/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 90197 96534: different question
16/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 89054 72730: He’s saying for d
16/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 89042 32230: acha
16/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 97395 33665: Cause it's becomes (address + 1) which points to nothing. If you want 2 then print (address)+1
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 97395 33665: Yeah 15 for second
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 97395 33665: Here it becomes address + 4 then sonit points to next array
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 90197 96534: ru sure abt this?
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 97395 33665: Check it once tho not sure
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 90366 74925: No idts
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 89054 72730: But won’t address +1 shift to next address
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 90197 96534: I've seen examples like *(*(p+3)+1)
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 90197 96534: for nested array
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 90366 74925: Ys
16/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 97395 33665: Compile it once and check
16/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 94495 71975: yes , but the next integer is at +4 , so garbage at +1 <This message was edited>
16/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 90197 96534: no like if u put +1
16/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 89054 72730: Its an integer pointer no
16/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 90197 96534: If goes to the next element
16/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 89054 72730: +1 means +4 in memory
16/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 90197 96534: like arr points to 0th element
16/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 90197 96534: arr + 1 points to 1st element
16/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 94495 71975: yeah nvm u r right
16/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 94495 71975: it should print 2
16/07/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 90197 96534: but what will come if u do the 2nd one tho?
16/07/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 89042 32230: you mean *(ptr)+1?
16/07/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 99015 54602: Can anyone please send insertfront deletefront programs?
16/07/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 89042 32230: output should be 3 ig.
16/07/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 97395 33665: I am getting 2 for both
16/07/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 97395 33665: So ig both works
16/07/2023, 10:01 pm - +91 97395 33665: 2
16/07/2023, 10:01 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ye
16/07/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 89042 32230: mb mb 1+1=2
16/07/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 89042 32230: correct
16/07/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 72598 06624: For this...*(ptr) gives value of a[0]...ur adding 1 to dat..so 2
16/07/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 90368 07007: <Media omitted>
16/07/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 89042 32230: but both dont mean the same. first case you are incrementing the address and second case, you are incrementing the value
16/07/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 90368 07007: <Media omitted>
16/07/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 89042 32230: yes yes
16/07/2023, 10:05 pm - +91 90366 74925: no , in this case thts all cuz *ptr is 1 , if first element was say 3 u would get 4
16/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 99015 54602: Thankyou!
16/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 97395 33665: Yeah

16/07/2023, 10:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: They zone out while writing the code that's how good they are
16/07/2023, 10:40 pm - +91 78998 03080: Someone knows what is coming in theory?

16/07/2023, 10:46 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I didn't make yet

I'll make in holidays only 🥲
16/07/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 78998 03080: Make now come on
16/07/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 97418 00513: Sure we'll learn it while we prepare for backlogs
16/07/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 78998 03080: And do it fast
16/07/2023, 10:48 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Easy to say pal
16/07/2023, 10:49 pm - +91 96866 30410: <Media omitted>
16/07/2023, 10:50 pm - +91 93532 54650: 33
16/07/2023, 10:51 pm - +91 96866 30410: How??
16/07/2023, 10:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: a+2 points to 33
While printing, it'll print 33
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: By default an array will point to it's head
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 97406 94534: Then it'll change 33 to 34
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 93532 54650: as *p++ is  postfix
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: Correct
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 89054 72730: what is we put ++*p
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: Should be 34
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 93532 54650: 34
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 89054 72730: How
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 93537 16080: error
16/07/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 93537 16080: oh wait
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - +91 98451 84874: 44
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: Heh
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - +91 93537 16080: 34
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - +91 93537 16080: This message was deleted
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - +91 93537 16080: you're incrementing 1 to 33
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you guys are confused with how pointers work, it's best to draw it out
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - +91 93537 16080: if you do *(++p) then its the next element
16/07/2023, 10:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yes
16/07/2023, 10:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: When you do int* p = any address/pointer, you're essentially mapping p (without the star) to that address
16/07/2023, 10:55 pm - +91 89054 72730: ++*p and ++(*p) both are same right?
16/07/2023, 10:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: When you perform a * operation, you get the value at that address
16/07/2023, 10:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: So now if you work it out, p gets assigned to a+2
16/07/2023, 10:55 pm - Aditeya Baral: Which means it is pointing to the address at which 33 is stored
16/07/2023, 10:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Now doing *p will fetch the value at the address, which is 33
16/07/2023, 10:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: So the question will print 33
16/07/2023, 10:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Now regarding the follow up
16/07/2023, 10:56 pm - +91 93537 16080: yes
16/07/2023, 10:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Similarly, if you do ++*p, it'll fetch the value first (33) and then increment it and use it
16/07/2023, 10:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: So you get 34
16/07/2023, 10:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Now on the other hand if you shift the order of the operators
16/07/2023, 10:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: And you do *(p++) then your address pointer moves ahead by 1, to point at 44. * of that gives 44 as value <This message was edited>
16/07/2023, 11:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: (Someone confirm pls)
16/07/2023, 11:04 pm - +91 89712 54123: isn't it the other way around?
16/07/2023, 11:04 pm - +91 93537 16080: Yep
16/07/2023, 11:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Hmmm
16/07/2023, 11:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Seems right to me
16/07/2023, 11:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Can someone code it out
16/07/2023, 11:04 pm - +91 93537 16080: Checked
16/07/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 93537 16080: *p++ is same as printing value ofp then incrementing p itself
++*p gets the value of p and adds 1 to it without changing p
16/07/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 94839 91979: You're right
16/07/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 93537 16080: Then everything else with brackets just works as expected, because its much easier to understand
16/07/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 89712 54123: ahh cool thx

17/07/2023, 12:10 am - +91 93537 39044: what happens in the case of a backlog? will isa marks not be considered?
17/07/2023, 12:10 am - +91 90197 96534: yes
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 93537 39044: so you can only score 50/100?
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 90197 96534: no
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 90197 96534: ur score out of 100 is taken as ur grade
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 72900 58727: I think it just doesn’t get scaled down
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 90197 96534: like if u get 70/100
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 90197 96534: then u get a B
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 93537 39044: ahhh
17/07/2023, 12:11 am - +91 93537 39044: can you give the paper again even after writing tomorrow?
17/07/2023, 12:12 am - +91 93537 39044: or is it a must for it to be a backlog
17/07/2023, 12:12 am - +91 97418 00513: Backlog
17/07/2023, 12:12 am - +91 97418 00513: Relax mate I'm in the same boat 💀
17/07/2023, 12:12 am - +91 93537 39044: 💀
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 93537 39044: it's a backlog only if you fail?
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 93537 39044: i have 43 in ISA
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 97418 00513: Counting the amount i need to score/ units
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 97418 00513: U passed already
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 77188 25988: Pretty much
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 93537 39044: bruh
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 97418 00513: Yea
17/07/2023, 12:13 am - +91 97418 00513: Don't need to pass ESA for it
17/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 77188 25988: Unless DoreMaga changes the rules slightly (committing a little bit of trolling)
17/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 72900 58727: Literally…all you need is to attend tomorrows exam
17/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 80734 96504: he has to be present for the exam tho
17/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 97418 00513: That he'll do no
17/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 97418 00513: Will they relatively grade?
17/07/2023, 12:14 am - +91 80734 96504: no
17/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 97418 00513: They supposed to if we all mess up right
17/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 93537 39044: no my plan is to get a backlog and then do well in the backlog to get a good grade cause theres no way im getting a good grade in tomorrow's exam
17/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 97418 00513: Sir tryna fail on purpose 💀
17/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 72900 58727: Yeah brother, unless you plan to bunk an ESA, you wanna ditch the plan
17/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 97418 00513: U can't even if u want to now
17/07/2023, 12:15 am - +91 97418 00513: Bunk tomorrow
17/07/2023, 12:16 am - +91 97418 00513: If u wanna do that
17/07/2023, 12:16 am - +91 93537 39044: hmm
17/07/2023, 12:16 am - +91 97418 00513: Fr, don't write it
17/07/2023, 12:16 am - +91 72900 58727: I think we qualify as bad influences
17/07/2023, 12:17 am - +91 94495 71975: What are we supposed to say 
"Study well , and hope it's an easy paper"
Hell no
17/07/2023, 12:17 am - +91 97418 00513: Hey, we're giving him what he wants
17/07/2023, 12:17 am - +91 97418 00513: We're just unbiased advisors
17/07/2023, 12:17 am - +91 93537 39044: lmao
17/07/2023, 12:17 am - +91 93537 39044: what can go wrong in the plan
17/07/2023, 12:18 am - +91 80734 96504: nigga is letting a 40+ isa score go lmao
17/07/2023, 12:18 am - +91 72900 58727: don't they mention that you had a backlog somewhere? I recollect someone saying it would affect placements or sm
17/07/2023, 12:18 am - +91 93537 39044: ohh
17/07/2023, 12:19 am - +91 97418 00513: U sure you'll do better in backlog?
17/07/2023, 12:19 am - +91 97418 00513: Nah
17/07/2023, 12:19 am - +91 97418 00513: Companies don't want an active backlog
17/07/2023, 12:19 am - +91 72900 58727: also that...unless you get over 86 in the backlog exam, you're better off writing tomorrow
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 97418 00513: No da
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 97418 00513: If he score 86 in backlog
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 97418 00513: He'll get A
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 90197 96534: honestly fax
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 97418 00513: No?
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 90197 96534: U need 74 tomorrow to score an AA
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 93537 39044: u mean 43
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 97418 00513: 40/100 in backlog is pass
17/07/2023, 12:20 am - +91 90197 96534: A*
17/07/2023, 12:21 am - +91 80734 96504: isa marks isnt included in backlog exams
17/07/2023, 12:21 am - +91 97418 00513: Yea
17/07/2023, 12:21 am - +91 97418 00513: But In backlog, each Mark is taken for face value
17/07/2023, 12:21 am - +91 80734 96504: ye
17/07/2023, 12:21 am - +91 97418 00513: So 1 mark is literally 1 mark
17/07/2023, 12:21 am - +91 80734 96504: he needs 74 tmr for an A
17/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 80734 96504: and 81 in backlog exam for an A
17/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 93537 39044: idk what to do💀
17/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 72900 58727: ye but tomorrow, his score will be added to a 43 isa score...it wont in backlog
17/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 72900 58727: pull an all nighter bro
17/07/2023, 12:22 am - +91 93537 39044: maybe i should just study

17/07/2023, 4:26 pm - Aditeya Baral: We're talking about someone's life here. Don't speculate, don't discuss, and most definitely do not send pictures
17/07/2023, 4:27 pm - Aditeya Baral: Everyone only has bits of information, and nobody is completely sure of the events that occurred. If you're curious, just wait a few hours. Things will be cleared by then.
17/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 97418 00513: Just to be clear

17/07/2023, 8:11 pm - +91 6361 790 234: or at least, speculatory behavior
17/07/2023, 8:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: Guys don't speculate or send around images. You're adding to the problem
17/07/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 97418 00513: It's in the news
17/07/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 98801 93913: Can you not, brother
17/07/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 98801 93913: It's fine... 
Let's just keep this matter aside..  
For sometime
17/07/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 98801 93913: Please
17/07/2023, 8:44 pm - +91 97418 00513: I don't get why no one wants to talk about it. This is the problem. No one wants to talk about what the problem is and conveniently turn a deaf ear to the issue. India is one of the places where seeking mental help gets you actively.judged in a negative way. Why can't we talk about the problem. When do you wanna talk about it? After the next victim? People are scared to reach out to seek help, and no wonder why. Are you guys uncomfortable discussing it? Well you should be ffs after all the whole "let's not talk about it" narrative is the reason why depressed students refuse to seek help
17/07/2023, 8:49 pm - +91 98801 93913: I'm not talking about not talking about mental health..  
It's the way you're portraying it.. 
What do you mean by "it's in the news" 
Is it in anyway telling you're supporting any sort of "justice" or any topic that's supporting mental health or anything...
This is not the problem
Problem is the way you keep telling bits and parts of it again and again... 
Some people are not as strong as you bro to handle listening to such news again and again..so sorry to say this..   but yeah... our mental health is also affected by knowing this news and as we try to forget it you again come up with a message ..  sorry bro..  not happening
17/07/2023, 8:50 pm - +91 97418 00513: So tl;Dr I wanna ignore
17/07/2023, 8:50 pm - +91 6361 790 234: in the moment, his death is simply a device to generate sensation and discussion.

I understand we want to talk about it, but the furthest we will discuss is how fucked our mental health as engineering students can really be, and nothing further. 

Let's just... lay low for a while
17/07/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 96320 07839: Articulated perfectly.
17/07/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 6361 790 234: nothing that we talk about now, will make a difference at all
17/07/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 98801 93913: This is exactly my point! 
Thank you dhruvv 🫶🏼
17/07/2023, 8:52 pm - +91 97418 00513: Least we could try n understand what happened? See I get some people are scared coz of it. But man people here literally tryna act like it didn't happen
17/07/2023, 8:52 pm - +91 96320 07839: The fact that he was our batchmate...
17/07/2023, 8:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: Exactly
17/07/2023, 8:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: I mean who saw it coming, and honestly, it could have been anyone of us
17/07/2023, 8:53 pm - +91 97418 00513: I knew him somewhat. Spoke to him 1-2 times. Good lad. Smart kid, very polite
17/07/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: He was in CS too
17/07/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 6361 790 234: it happened
its very real and extremely scary, but coming to grips with grim realities takes time, 

let's take an example,
here's how any discussion now is gonna go.

"yeah man, shits fucked"
"I'm there for you bro"
(proceeds to not be there for them)

none of us are prepared for a discussion, especially not now.
17/07/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: Fair
17/07/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 6361 790 234: its a deep rooted issue
17/07/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 73532 91375: That's not important here
17/07/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 97418 00513: I mean it shows how smart he was
17/07/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 6361 790 234: and it'll take years,

of us changing our approach, 
an approach from the elder gen
and our kids even
17/07/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 73532 91375: A branch does not determine the smartness🙏
17/07/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: I mean sure, but YK how engineering kids are. Aight disregard tha stat
17/07/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 97418 00513: Statement
17/07/2023, 8:57 pm - +91 97418 00513: It should actually start from us YK, boomers actively denied having mental health issues. Now of course we do not know what the exact cause was here and the wild speculations being made so far distorts the truth
17/07/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 6361 790 234: when it comes by, the only thing you can do is mourn.

you can bargain, fall into sadness, and all of the routine stages of grief.
We all feel very passionately about the detriments of our mental health awareness,

but discussing and making intellectual conclusions, will skip all of those stages I mentioned above, and walk straight into acceptance.

thats how we desensitize ourselves
17/07/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 6361 790 234: wanting to talk is not wrong at all but
17/07/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 97418 00513: I mean ATP the reality is sad
17/07/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 6361 790 234: 2 days in, after all that, we forget this even happened
17/07/2023, 9:00 pm - +91 97418 00513: Like we've all accepted like "it happens"
17/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 97418 00513: Point
17/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 6361 790 234: kya karen yaar, ab ho gaya hai aisa.
17/07/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 6361 790 234: let's just give it time
17/07/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 96323 92436: No
17/07/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 90199 42460: Brother are you seeking mental help, or a casual convo about a dead person on a group with over 1000 participants
17/07/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 6361 790 234: its more of a question we ask ourselves now. Let's just hope nothing unnecessary circulates here. I've seen pictures flood my class groups today with videos added for good measure
17/07/2023, 9:14 pm - +91 90199 42460: It's retarded
17/07/2023, 9:14 pm - +91 6361 790 234: for the lack of a better word, yes.
17/07/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 90199 42460: It's like that youtuber who sold pic of the autopsy of a murdered child on her patreon
17/07/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 91087 96229: Logan Paul moment
17/07/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 90192 63571: Yo @919741800513 ,

17/07/2023, 10:52 pm - +91 88266 92108: nvm
17/07/2023, 10:55 pm - +91 94839 91979: I'll just put one thing out there, talking about him here in the group isn't going to make anyone's mental health better, it's a topic many are uncomfortable with, if talking here would release the pressure then maybe it wouldn't even have happened, once again, talking here is not gonna fix anything, it's just gossip for people, and okay not for the sake of the people in this group, have some respect to the person that just passed away, have some respect to him, a person lost his life,*it's not a topic for us to gossip about*
17/07/2023, 10:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: Guys who want to talk about it, please understand. We're not asking you to stay quiet about mental health and suicide - it's very important to speak up about it.
17/07/2023, 10:56 pm - +91 88266 92108: I agree totally and I think ppl here are mature enough not to have gossips here
17/07/2023, 10:56 pm - Aditeya Baral: The reason we didn't want people talking about it is to curb the gossip and rumours being spread before the news came out officially
17/07/2023, 10:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: There is a goddamn difference between asking people to shut up about spreading made up information and talking about mental health
17/07/2023, 10:57 pm - +91 88266 92108: this was the best point so far
17/07/2023, 10:58 pm - +91 88266 92108: If this is the reason then I think we should've stopped iscussing
17/07/2023, 10:58 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I've only one thing to say: think twice before taking such a drastic measure. Just imagine what you'll leave behind on your near and dear ones. I've had a suicide victim in my family not a week ago, imagine how it would have affected me rn. Just be assured that your friends and family is always there to help you, academically, mentally or emotionally.
17/07/2023, 10:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: We're asking you to stop sharing the pictures around, stop speculating, stop hypothesising the situation. That person could have been any of you. He was literally right there with you today, writing the exam just like everyone. Before you speculate, just think for a moment that it could have been someone you walked past today.
17/07/2023, 11:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: So when people don't want to talk about it, especially people close to him, there is a reason. Atleast try to understand what people who know him are going through. Just imagine talking to your friend before an exam and then not getting to ever see them again.
17/07/2023, 11:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: So either stay quiet about it and give people their space and time, or talk about mental health and how people can reach out to you. Don't discuss what could have happened.

19/07/2023, 12:02 am - +91 99014 37680: so you can score that one properly
19/07/2023, 12:02 am - +91 99014 37680: the other two are mid
19/07/2023, 12:02 am - +91 6366 682 139: Is 9.5+ SGPA possible??

19/07/2023, 2:16 pm - +91 90192 63571: Guys, 
It's indeed a very sad and shocking news for all of us. 
The main purpose of the group was for study related discussions. So I would like to keep it that way. And I'm not sure how a discussion about this would go. 
Someone has already sent her number in the group. If anyone wants to text her, do DM her.
19/07/2023, 2:17 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Nope, dming them isn't gonna be right
19/07/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 6366 682 139: One person close to him could DM them and get to know what happened
19/07/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 95084 21687: +1
19/07/2023, 2:18 pm - +91 6366 682 139: And then share it here
19/07/2023, 2:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: I agree. If people want information, someone can volunteer, get information, and then post about it here.
19/07/2023, 2:20 pm - +91 6360 374 242: This message was deleted
19/07/2023, 2:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also whoever is volunteering, remember that whatever information you provide will almost guaranteed be forwarded to every single group, friend etc in your batch.
19/07/2023, 2:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: So you will be held accountable for the information you provide. Please understand the gravity of the situation before volunteering
19/07/2023, 2:21 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I feel it will be real awkward speaking to 1024 strangers..
19/07/2023, 2:21 pm - +91 6366 682 139: So yeah one person contact is better
19/07/2023, 2:26 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Now wait a second...

You say they are Aditya's sister

But the news reports he's the only son..
19/07/2023, 2:35 pm - +91 78297 70134: delete this also she's probably tired already no need to let random people dm her asking her the same questions
19/07/2023, 2:38 pm - +91 91087 96229: The news never lies ever
They totally don't make u believe what u want to believe by hiding and manipulating what they show

19/07/2023, 8:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: Something feels off about this. I'm not going to stop anyone, but I find it extremely odd that his family would be commenting on reddit and creating/joining a WhatsApp group to get students on board when it's been just 48 hours since the incident.
19/07/2023, 8:05 pm - +91 6366 682 139: The group description too..
19/07/2023, 8:05 pm - +91 6366 682 139: <Media omitted>
19/07/2023, 8:05 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah I saw that
19/07/2023, 8:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: And after reading the reddit comments, it sounds a little far fetched for PES. If it is indeed true, it's very fucked up. But honestly at this point I don't see any proof that it is indeed the family which is posting on reddit. It honestly seems like a 3rd party here is trying to "deliver" justice to PES
19/07/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 6366 682 139: a reddit post?? Can i get the link??
19/07/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 97418 00513: Mate it's his friends who confirmed it
19/07/2023, 8:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: https://www.reddit.com/r/PESU/comments/1520u2w/a_student_just_committed_suicide_in_college_today/
19/07/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 97418 00513: That it was indeed the case, the harrasment
19/07/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 97418 00513: Also, checked with the numbers. It's his parents
19/07/2023, 8:11 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Man the comments... I really dk what to believe and whom to trust now...
19/07/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 73532 91375: Same
19/07/2023, 8:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: The number might be his parents'. I'm referring to the social media attention this has been gathering since today afternoon
19/07/2023, 8:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: As I said, you're free to have your opinion, nobody is going to stop you. But there are some missing links in the story, and some implausible comments on it which make it difficult.
19/07/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: I mean u could join n see for your self?
19/07/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: Sooner or later, we will find out who is behind this
19/07/2023, 8:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: I could, yes, but then I'd be adding myself to a movement which I have doubts about.
19/07/2023, 8:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: As I said, we can agree to disagree
19/07/2023, 8:17 pm - +91 97418 00513: You're not really participating yet tbh
19/07/2023, 8:17 pm - +91 73532 91375: Nor u r doing man
19/07/2023, 8:17 pm - +91 97418 00513: I'm having an open mind here, what you say could possibly be true
19/07/2023, 8:18 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I too am not a part of the movement, tho I'm in the group..
19/07/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 90069 45674: Good luck telling that to the management if they ever ask about the group or anything
19/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 6361 631 974: hmm this seems very odd
19/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 6361 631 974: even for pes this seems too much, can't really say anything about it tbf
19/07/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I left it
19/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 90069 45674: I mean I just hope you guys understand whatever you're getting into by joining that group
19/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Tbh they can get pretty abusive
19/07/2023, 8:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: This.
19/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Not a first for an Indian colleges
19/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: College*
19/07/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 6361 631 974: I've not seen that level of abuse yet so I won't say anything
19/07/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: It happened behind closed doors
19/07/2023, 8:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: Which further brings into question about evidence, just saying
19/07/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: C'mon mate some sympathy please
19/07/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 93292 42883: guys if y'all wanna join do it...if y'all dont wanna then dont its as simple as that really...everyone on here is gonna have their own opinion lets not try and influence that?
19/07/2023, 8:23 pm - +91 6361 631 974: see I really do feel bad about the kid and his parents for whatever happened, its not a matter of sympathy. Its just all very confusing
19/07/2023, 8:23 pm - Aditeya Baral: We feel sorry for the dude. We aren't saying otherwise. We're just saying, know what you're getting into and be prepared for what's to come. Good or bad
19/07/2023, 8:23 pm - +91 6361 631 974: lets just wait and see what happens
19/07/2023, 8:23 pm - +91 77953 89834: Nothing’s gonna happen
19/07/2023, 8:24 pm - +91 90069 45674: You don't know how the management and everyone else will react to whatever goes on, or will happen in future. So just beware and don't get carried away with emotions. It's sad wtv happened but just know the gravity of the situation
19/07/2023, 8:24 pm - +91 77953 89834: Exactly
19/07/2023, 8:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: Let's say what his parents are saying is true
19/07/2023, 8:25 pm - +91 97418 00513: And the management caused his death. Y'all have it in you to protest?
19/07/2023, 8:25 pm - +91 77953 89834: Bullshit
19/07/2023, 8:26 pm - +91 70221 26187: @919741800513 the police exists for a reason you dont need to act like some alpha figure..let the authorities handle it
19/07/2023, 8:26 pm - +91 77953 89834: Bruh end of the day everyone has their own point, so there’s no point in discussing it among ourselves. It’s in the hands of the college parents and the law.
19/07/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 77953 89834: Exactly 😂

19/07/2023, 8:31 pm - +91 97418 00513: Oh right, I almost forgot about the face of justice, the ultimate savior of students, Bangalore Police 💦💦
19/07/2023, 8:31 pm - +91 82965 44577: tbh in every artice or post PES name hasnt been mentioned once

19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: A bunch of people started w their conspiracy theories about it being some third party lol
19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 94839 91979: If you're so concerned about people's mental health, instead of doing this bullshit here, maybe look out for people around you, doing this "heroic" act won't save anyone, you're not cool, settle down
19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 77953 89834: Yea
19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: Hero? What am I doing this for attention?
19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 94839 91979: Probably
19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 97418 00513: 🥰🥰

19/07/2023, 8:34 pm - +91 90199 42460: Sounds like it
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Yea arguing here is pointless
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 70221 26187: @919741800513 Accept the fact that youre just using mental health as an excuse to gossip and get attention
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: Then stop
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: Lol look at your insensitivity
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 94839 91979: The irony
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 77953 89834: Yes please for god’s sake
19/07/2023, 8:35 pm - +91 97418 00513: I'm out, I did my job of sending the link

19/07/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 77953 89834: ✅
19/07/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 94499 22481: It's ur personal decision. Make it wisely
19/07/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: Just so YK, y'all are all just crabs in a bucket
19/07/2023, 8:36 pm - +91 97418 00513: True

19/07/2023, 8:37 pm - +91 98451 84874: Exactly..
Anything abt that topic has to  be spoken in that separate group created..
This is a study purpose group as far as I believe..
19/07/2023, 8:38 pm - +91 77953 89834: <Media omitted>
19/07/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 96320 07839: Perfect
Someone had to say it
19/07/2023, 8:41 pm - +91 97418 00513: I left it at leaving a link to discuss this in another group. But some people are obviously too smart and of course then there are the conspiracy theorists 🥰
19/07/2023, 8:42 pm - +91 96065 00577: Bruh
19/07/2023, 8:44 pm - +91 94839 91979: You are one as well fam so please stfu

19/07/2023, 8:48 pm - +91 94495 71975: 😶😶
19/07/2023, 8:56 pm - Your security code with ~ Prakruthi changed. Tap to learn more.
19/07/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 79753 44379: At this point everything other than Wht the police is telling and Wht is in news is a conspiracy theory
19/07/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 6361 790 234: a good bunch of people here are not going to concern themselves with what could be a rather bold attempt.

Its an entire battalion of officials you're gonna have to face. I do understand that there's a whole new angle to this story but, I can see why people would back off.

each to their own I guess?
19/07/2023, 9:34 pm - +91 6361 790 234: on another note, not to sound stupid really. There is another group for this.

I've been holding this back for two days, but what are the changes to the AI ML syllabus :/
19/07/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 6361 790 234: haven't seen the university say jack shit about it
19/07/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 6361 631 974: I think we just suffer mate
19/07/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 6361 790 234: that I can agree with
19/07/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ig we should everything on or own
19/07/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 90197 96534: Some senior told right
19/07/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 6361 790 234: asking this two days back would've gotten me canceled so
19/07/2023, 9:36 pm - +91 6361 790 234: in the sense?
19/07/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 6361 790 234: like yes, most of the teachers arent qualified to teach ML and we'll mostly learn shit on our own but💀
19/07/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 77188 25988: I heard that during the 2nd year the AI students would have the same syllabus as the CS guys
19/07/2023, 9:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: They will make it up as you go along lmao
19/07/2023, 9:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: You're the first batch anyway
19/07/2023, 9:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: There's at most 5 profs who actually know ML and have contributed to research
19/07/2023, 9:38 pm - +91 99014 37680: Oh yea

AI/ML peeps
please upload to BetterPES 🙏
19/07/2023, 9:39 pm - Aditeya Baral: Everyone else is an import scikit learn person who is publishing papers on basic models applied to different datasets
19/07/2023, 9:39 pm - +91 6361 790 234: you see my brother @916366682139 here?

yeah exactly.. we got you covered
19/07/2023, 9:39 pm - +91 6361 790 234: that is very encouraging :D
19/07/2023, 9:40 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yess lessgo

Leave it to me

Once it comes out I'll do it
19/07/2023, 9:40 pm - +91 6361 790 234: to be fair most of it is python as well, so I guess you're chill in that department man
19/07/2023, 9:41 pm - +91 73389 36843: 💀
19/07/2023, 9:41 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Ohh I didn't know this..
19/07/2023, 9:41 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But how did you know it
19/07/2023, 9:41 pm - +91 6361 790 234: that isn't necessarily bad to be honest, as basic as the first semester syllabus is, the fact that you're able to connect the dots from one sub to another itself was a good indicator of how they update the syllabus
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: I'm really happy I joined here
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: I don't have any regrets at all
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: None
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: 🤡
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 6361 790 234: ay
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 6361 790 234: I got IIT B cse
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - Aditeya Baral: Its very sad lmao
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 6361 790 234: but I still came here
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 6361 790 234: of course you made the right choice
19/07/2023, 9:42 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lol bro is determined to make all 1024 regret joining here
19/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 6361 790 234: 💀💀
19/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 90197 96534: It was for this msg
19/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 90197 96534: Mb
19/07/2023, 9:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: Most "ML specialist" profs here barely know more than online courses. And their knowledge is shallow and limited to just "try this model its bigger so better lolz"
19/07/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 6361 790 234: but tbf to you @919686041205 you've done a pretty good job being on the fence when it comes to college opinions. Nice to have seniors like you around
19/07/2023, 9:43 pm - Aditeya Baral: They think that applying 3 different (existing) models on a new dataset counts as research
19/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 90197 96534: Yes fax tho
19/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 96057 85091: I heard silico has a huge python with him so yeah chill only
19/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 6361 790 234: well, thats what I did in I/O as well so💀💀
19/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yeah yours is the only unbiased opinion I have seen of PES
19/07/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 6361 790 234: <Media omitted>
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: I try my best to always be objective guys. Being biased does not help anyone
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Exactly
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah and that is all these profs know
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But that pros and cons of PES you posted in reddit, I just admire it everyday
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6361 790 234: so Andrew Ng ftw?
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I've never done such a deep analysis myself
19/07/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 73389 36843: No tinygrad 😢
19/07/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 73389 36843: Certified aiml moment
19/07/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 6361 790 234: he was deep learning before ai even came to this college
19/07/2023, 9:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: And honestly most of these ML profs also don't keep up with research. They barely know beyond the syllabus, and most of them read it out as well. I have seen some of them asking you to check online for resources when you ask them for help lmao
19/07/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 90197 96534: Yup
19/07/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 6366 682 139: No cap lmao
19/07/2023, 9:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: Wow xD
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 90197 96534: But Andrew ng's course on coursera is very expensive
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 90197 96534: 8k for 2 months or something
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: Financial aid ftw
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 6361 790 234: thats what our math teacher did with discontinous probability as well💀 but we let it slide I guess
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 90197 96534: There is one yt tho
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 6361 790 234: for free almost no?
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 90197 96534: It's a playlist
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 90197 96534: Ig it's 2017/2017
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 90197 96534: Not sure
19/07/2023, 9:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: No almost, you can get it for free
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 90197 96534: How?
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 6361 790 234: my sme had certifications from Andrew ng
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 6361 790 234: I must tell you
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 6361 790 234: he went above and beyond
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 6361 790 234: to teach us ml
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 6361 790 234: and sadly he might be the best I've had here
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 90190 39181: about this,
can you upload ECE third sem syllabus too if possible
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - Aditeya Baral: There are like 3-4 at most who actually do proper research. But with all the research labs here going to shit even that will stop
19/07/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 6361 790 234: you might know him, he's a 3rd year student
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - Aditeya Baral: Just put in a statement how you are extremely poor and this will help you get career opportunities
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 6361 790 234: Shreyas Battula?
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - Aditeya Baral: Name?
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lol it's that simple?
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 79750 80168: that template financial aid statement is so usefull, always get free financial aid with that
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - Aditeya Baral: Hmm no haven't heard
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 6361 790 234: if he does do I/O next sem, I might go again
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 79750 80168: yeah
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 6361 790 234: yeah, god bless that you tuber lmao
19/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 6361 790 234: I think it takes 15 days for approval?
19/07/2023, 9:50 pm - +91 6361 790 234: nice guy man
19/07/2023, 9:50 pm - Aditeya Baral: yes
19/07/2023, 9:50 pm - +91 6361 790 234: taught us quite well, can't expect him to be god level, but I do retain what he's taught us
19/07/2023, 9:50 pm - +91 89042 32230: Interesting.
19/07/2023, 9:50 pm - +91 6361 790 234: this like kbc bro
19/07/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 6361 790 234: "meri maa takli hai sahab, unki maang hi nahi milti😭"

and the question he has to answer to win a crore is like simple addition or some bs
19/07/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 97395 33665: So you are telling me placements is just like talent shows
19/07/2023, 9:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: Bruh no read for full context lol
19/07/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 73389 36843: @919686041205 can we get the aiml faculty to use tinygrad as a learning tool?
19/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 73389 36843: Or will they completely disregard it?
19/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 89042 32230: He was talking about getting free courses online
19/07/2023, 9:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: If you know the answer why are you asking lmao
19/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 73389 36843: I don't 😭
19/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 73389 36843: Since its a new branch I was under the impression that they'd have some up to date syllabus
19/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 73532 91375: Aditya talking to aditya
19/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 73532 91375: <Media omitted>

19/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 94495 71975: lol thats a cute assumption
19/07/2023, 9:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: You do realise the courses you will have are already there right
19/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 73389 36843: Real
19/07/2023, 9:58 pm - Aditeya Baral: Your "new branch" was basically a specialisation
19/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 73389 36843: So only ml electives?
19/07/2023, 9:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: It was called the MIDS specialisation, you can view the courses on PES Media or old course syllabi pdfs. They will probably add more electives for you
19/07/2023, 9:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Our MIDS was ML + some other ones
19/07/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 73389 36843: Right I see
19/07/2023, 11:08 pm - +91 99014 37680: we need all the shit

19/07/2023, 11:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Can you ask people to raise PRs?
19/07/2023, 11:11 pm - +91 99014 37680: nvm man's second year
19/07/2023, 11:11 pm - +91 99014 37680: not PR's

I am Aditya Prabhu's mother. He was a student of PES college, RR road campus, CSE 1st year student. On July 17th Aditya jumped from 8th floor of a building in the campus and committed suicide.  The college announced to the media that Aditya was caught cheating and copying during examination. He was detained.  He  was counselled and when he was told that parents would be informed, he jumped from the building. I want to tell our  side of story here. 

I got a call from Aditya at 11:45 am July 17th. He told me that  he forgot to put the phone back in his bag and the phone remained in his pant  pocket . He remembered it halfway thru the exam and himself took it and kept it away from him either on the bench or the floor(I can't remember his exact words).  And the phone was in airplane mode  . The invigilator saw it and detained him. He wrote the full exam. 
Aditya also told that they r harrassing him, they told him it's better to die than do such things and asked me to come to college. After some time, I got call from his mentor in college asking me to come. Later I got to know from students in the class that the invigilators saw the mobile at 11:26am with only 4 mins remaining for the end of the exam. When I reached there, no one was in the office and I was told to wait. I waited for nearly 1 hour.  Then the mentor and COE arrived.  I was called to office . And they started looking for Aditya.  They said they had told Aditya to sit there. They asked around a bit, everyone said he was sitting there. They told me he must be roaming around with friends. I said it's impossible that he will go out with friends when such serious charges r lodged against him. I started demanding that they look in cc tv cameras for him and that he might be  in danger if he wasn't sitting there. They still kept telling he is out with friends. After some time, they started making some calls. And then they rushed out. I followed them. We walked quite a lot and came to other end of the campus.  I could see ambulance and police already there. That is when I started shouting what has happened to my son.  On shouting a lot I was informed that he isn't alive. I asked them to take him to hospital and try to revive him. What I was told next is unbelievable... I was told that I need to recognise him first and sign a statement and then they will take him to hospital and try to revive him. Even though I was alone, they took me( 2 or 3 of them holding me) to recognise my son's body.  Which is absolutely inhuman when I think about it now.  Once I agreed that it's Aditya, they gave me something to sign and told that as soon as I sign , they will take him to hospital. Again and again I was pressurised to sign. It was probably something that would wash off their   hands from the matter. They were trying to take advantage of my emotional  state since I was alone. My friend arrived soon and he asked me not to sign anything till my family arrives. Then my family and friends arrived and demanded investigation.  Only after that forensic team was called, dog squad was called, cctv cameras were looked into, police started asking questions and taking statements from everyone.  This went on till 7: 30 pm. And not a single person from college , Dean, CEO, professors, COE, his mentor came there to check. Only a admin was present. At 7:30;,VC came and met us and said they r very sorry for what happened. They r deeply hurt and such. 

Yesterday autopsy was done and he was cremated.  No communication from the  college at all.. 

I have few questions...

1. They saw the mobile and caught him at 11:26am with only 4 mins remaining for the exams to end. If he was copying, what were the 2 invigilators were doing for the whole 2 hours and 56 mins. Didn't they see anything then? And if at 11:56, he was caught copying would they have allowed him to complete the exam? 
2.  Even if  he had cheated,  just follow the procedure. Why mentally harass the student.
3. After detaining him, why was he left unattended. After putting such serious allegations on him, shouldn't somebody be with him. After all he was a 19yr old kid. Some  are sensitive, how could they leave him alone.
4. I also got to know that, they told the police that the boy who jumped isn't their college student, and is  some random person who walked in. They pressurized the police to move away the body. I was waiting in the college from 12:50 pm.  I saw the body at around 2:15 pm. Even though the college was aware of his jump, why wasn't I informed earlier. 

That's  because they just wanted the body to go off their campus and wash off their hands. They wanted to protect their reputation.

Could all this be avoided?
If  my son wasn't harassed, painful and harsh words weren't spoken, if he wasn't left alone and unattended , perhaps this could have been avoided. Wasn't it the mentor's duty to stay with my son? 
Students have come forward telling that same things happened with them and they were badly harassed. They were told that their career is over, their life is destroyed, they will never get a job and such. 
My poor boy just panicked that his reputation is destroyed and took this extreme step.

 I agree carrying the mobile inside the examination hall, even when done unintentionally was wrong. 
But he didn't deserve the harrssement that pushed him to take this extreme step. He didn't deserve to be left alone either. 
After his death, he deserved the respect that   his body be identified instead of  hushing it up and just moving it as unidentified body to a morgue.

I just want the college to accept their mistake in this, and change their SOP regarding students involved in such situations, so that another life is not lost in future. I want to clear my son's name. Taking a mobile inside is not same as caught copying.  I want justice for my son.

Idk what his mother (my whole condolences to her n r everyone affected) but r the pes members just supposed to assume that he didn't copy at all?
Well maybe he might not have but at that time seemed like the only viable thing..
20/07/2023, 7:53 am - +91 91086 81056: But yeah the harras8ng n unattending the student is wrong...
Overall what's happened has happened...

28/07/2023, 10:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: Your total credit count at the end of 4 years is 160

They are secretly trying to teach you all this
Engineering and all is secondary
This is the main thing
29/07/2023, 7:54 am - +91 78998 03080: Kya hua 22 credits nahi mila kya

29/07/2023, 10:12 am - +91 78998 03080: Dhoni reason hai Aashiqui because I trust you to get more than 22 credits
29/07/2023, 10:18 am - Aditeya Baral: Minor credits are also counted separately
29/07/2023, 10:19 am - Aditeya Baral: So you can't really substitute credits here
29/07/2023, 10:41 am - +91 6361 631 974: Ye they're teaching u business
29/07/2023, 10:52 am - +91 87553 16048: Can we give improvement exams in pes?

29/07/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 74112 64188: Its enabled. And there's no option to disable it.
29/07/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 73389 36843: You're on windows 11 right?
29/07/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 74112 64188: Yeah
29/07/2023, 7:07 pm - +91 73389 36843: Try searching for the bitlocker manager
29/07/2023, 7:08 pm - +91 91087 96229: No

29/07/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 73389 36843: Time to ditch NTFS for LUKS btrfs
29/07/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 91087 96229: I use ext4
29/07/2023, 7:10 pm - +91 73389 36843: Good

29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 74112 64188: I tried disabling on shell. Access was denied. Even though I'm an admin.
29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 73389 36843: Eh hold on
29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 85537 17575: Go to the settings app and type in encryption in the search bar
29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 73389 36843: You used PSH right?
29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 73389 36843: Try turning off device encryption first
29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 73389 36843: In the settings
29/07/2023, 7:14 pm - +91 85537 17575: I found it on win11 home
29/07/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 73389 36843: Also are you turning encryption off to dual boot?
29/07/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 74112 64188: Yeah
29/07/2023, 7:15 pm - +91 73389 36843: Then I'd suggest running windows 10 instead
29/07/2023, 7:16 pm - +91 85537 17575: Try settings > privacy and security > encryption

29/07/2023, 7:18 pm - +91 85537 17575: The blue toggle switch is the answer
29/07/2023, 7:18 pm - +91 74112 64188: Yeah trying that
29/07/2023, 7:19 pm - +91 73389 36843: Just backup, install windows 10 and then dual boot. Windows 11 isn't worth it with the number of times it breaks grub and messes with your Linux install

29/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 73532 91375: Also, can we view the papers first and then apply for reval?
29/07/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 73532 91375: Or do we have to apply for reval only?

31/07/2023, 10:33 am - +91 89054 72730: There are special topics?
31/07/2023, 10:34 am - +91 99456 67559: Yeah 2 credits iirc
31/07/2023, 10:41 am - +91 91132 16705: CSE peeps have to pick one out of four iirc
31/07/2023, 10:41 am - +91 91132 16705: According to PES Media discord we have
31/07/2023, 10:41 am - +91 91132 16705: Julia
C++
R
or Bash scripting
31/07/2023, 10:42 am - +91 91132 16705: idk for other branches
31/07/2023, 10:48 am - Aditeya Baral: This list sometimes changes btw
31/07/2023, 10:48 am - Aditeya Baral: But yeah usually C++, R and bash are always there
31/07/2023, 10:49 am - Aditeya Baral: Choose whichever interests you. These are easy courses and people study only 1-2 days before the ESAs lmao
31/07/2023, 10:49 am - +91 89054 72730: What do most people pick
31/07/2023, 10:49 am - +91 91132 16705: doesn't R tie into Statistics?
31/07/2023, 10:50 am - Aditeya Baral: Again, pick what interests you
31/07/2023, 10:50 am - Aditeya Baral: Yeah
31/07/2023, 10:50 am - Aditeya Baral: R and the statistics course have a good 60-70% overlap
31/07/2023, 10:50 am - Aditeya Baral: Statistics course is theoretical, R  course will require you to implement those things
31/07/2023, 10:51 am - Aditeya Baral: Julia is used for scientific operations mainly, can also be used for general math computations
31/07/2023, 10:51 am - +91 91132 16705: like Matlab?
31/07/2023, 10:51 am - Aditeya Baral: If you don't have any particular interest, pick C++. It'll help with placements
31/07/2023, 10:52 am - Aditeya Baral: Similar, yes. I never had Julia as an option so can't comment, but people did like the Julia course
31/07/2023, 10:52 am - +91 77188 25988: What's Bash scripting about?
31/07/2023, 10:52 am - Aditeya Baral: Mostly Linux based stuff

31/07/2023, 11:13 am - +91 99014 37680: If you can't do it in this time
You can pick it up in final year
31/07/2023, 11:13 am - +91 78998 03080: Rt now on some website or later after college starts

31/07/2023, 11:14 am - +91 99014 37680: I don't think you'll have special topic
31/07/2023, 11:14 am - +91 99014 37680: We'll see
31/07/2023, 11:34 am - +91 78998 03080: I see special PPL like me don't get to choose special topics

31/07/2023, 4:17 pm - +91 74112 64188: Hey which IDE would be best for Linux ?
Is VS code fine ?
31/07/2023, 4:17 pm - +91 91087 96229: Oh mate there r people in this group who will skin u for asking this question
31/07/2023, 4:18 pm - +91 74112 64188: 😅 why
31/07/2023, 4:19 pm - +91 6361 631 974: in simple words vs code heavy
31/07/2023, 4:19 pm - +91 74112 64188: New to Linux. Was trying to figure out
31/07/2023, 4:19 pm - +91 6361 631 974: but then again im not the expert
31/07/2023, 4:19 pm - +91 91087 96229: See it depends on what u wanna do and how fast u type etc
31/07/2023, 4:20 pm - +91 95084 21687: NeoVim with NvChad config🤓
31/07/2023, 4:20 pm - +91 91087 96229: If u r a normal dude and u just wanna get work done then use vs code
If u r built for speed and u type >150 wpm and u Hate the mouse use nvim
If u wanna attract ~girls~ cucks then use emacs or vim
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 88614 91079: Emacs users aren't getting any girls
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 88614 91079: Or men
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 88614 91079: Or anyone
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 74112 64188: Is it harder to use the others ?
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 88614 91079: Yeah
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 73389 36843: If you're on linux id say use a terminal based text editor like nvim. But if you really want to use vscode, install this package called codium, is the same as vscode but "de-microsofted"
31/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 91087 96229: Pdf files r attracted to them thi
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 88614 91079: Much higher learning curve
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 73389 36843: Not really learning how to use modal text editors take barely any time
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 91087 96229: Don't use vs codium
It's extension ecosystem is shit
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 73389 36843: Only emacs orgmode
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yes just use nvim
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 91087 96229: Use vs code
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 73389 36843: Codium is only when you absolutely have to
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 73389 36843: Eh
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 91087 96229: Don't use nvim
Learning curve not worth it
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 88614 91079: Based
31/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 73532 91375: Change of branch/change of campus....
What?
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 73389 36843: Use nano 💀
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 91087 96229: I personally use my laptop to do work
Not to rice the os and make it look good
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 96320 07839: Cultured.
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 74112 64188: Getting a lot of mixed responses.
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 73389 36843: Use what you wany
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 91087 96229: So I don't use nvim or emacs
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 74112 64188: Just learned how to use nano
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 73389 36843: Doesn't really matter
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 88614 91079: Exactly
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 91087 96229: Unlearn it fast
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 73389 36843: Nano is fine for small edits
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 88614 91079: Try all of it out
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 73389 36843: But still very unwieldy
31/07/2023, 4:27 pm - +91 88614 91079: See wat works for you
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Nvim good for small edits
Vs code good for everything else
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 73389 36843: If you're able to get work done with vscode then stick with it
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Just make sure to not use sublime text
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 73389 36843: Nvim is good for everything
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 74112 64188: Just want something that's fast and will execute my code efficiently.
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 73389 36843: Real
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 73389 36843: I used to be sublime purist
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Bro learning curve for beginner is not worth it
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: I use it
Therefore I'm saying
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yeah just use anything you want
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 73389 36843: Vscode will do
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Don't use gedit
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Don't use sublime text
31/07/2023, 4:28 pm - +91 91087 96229: Don't use nano
31/07/2023, 4:29 pm - +91 81056 35154: Mate just write the code on paper
31/07/2023, 4:29 pm - +91 73389 36843: The problem with nvim is that you'd have to setup a lot on your own
31/07/2023, 4:29 pm - +91 73389 36843: If you dont want that just use vscode
31/07/2023, 4:29 pm - +91 91087 96229: I personally use clay tablets when I need permanency
31/07/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 91087 96229: Maximum permanency
Like "I need it to be read after 1000 yrs" kind of permanency
31/07/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 74112 64188: For now I think I'll set up vs code. Quiet familiar with it.
31/07/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yeah it should do
31/07/2023, 4:30 pm - +91 91087 96229: Quite*

31/07/2023, 6:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: And thats the end of the "math" courses

03/08/2023, 11:47 am - Aditeya Baral: Move it to hackerspace org pls
03/08/2023, 11:47 am - +91 73389 36843: Yes

03/08/2023, 11:49 am - +91 6366 682 139: I ain't a part of hackerspace
03/08/2023, 11:49 am - Aditeya Baral: Issok, the project can be hosted there and people can contribute to that
03/08/2023, 11:49 am - Aditeya Baral: It will give people incentive during hacktoberfest and the like too
03/08/2023, 11:52 am - +91 6366 682 139: Bruh let this be an independent project <This message was edited>
03/08/2023, 11:53 am - Aditeya Baral: If you really mind, then sure no pressure. Just that there were more benefits of having it as a project everyone could contribute to

03/08/2023, 11:54 am - Aditeya Baral: So the goal was to keep these kind of "useful for everyone" projects under HackerSpace so that these can be found by later batches easily. The issue with keeping it under a personal GitHub is that as new batches join your personal profile becomes less relevant and searchable
03/08/2023, 11:57 am - +91 6366 682 139: Ahh okay...
03/08/2023, 11:57 am - +91 6366 682 139: So what should I do??
03/08/2023, 11:58 am - Aditeya Baral: Its upto you. We would like it to be part of HackerSpace org. You will also get to be the maintainer and owner of that particular repo
03/08/2023, 11:58 am - +91 6366 682 139: okay
03/08/2023, 11:58 am - Aditeya Baral: But if you dont want it to be, then sure
03/08/2023, 11:58 am - +91 6366 682 139: no, if my work will help people, it is obvious i put it somewhere where everyone can see
03/08/2023, 11:58 am - Aditeya Baral: For example, the auth system that PESU Discord uses was made by me. Its on the HackerSpace org but I am the owner on that repo so PRs and things still go through me
03/08/2023, 11:59 am - +91 6366 682 139: tell me what should i do
03/08/2023, 11:59 am - Aditeya Baral: Let Icarus text me first, I need to add him to the org along with you (or he can add) and then migrate the repo to the org
03/08/2023, 12:00 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Okay

03/08/2023, 7:51 pm - Aditeya Baral: Your ESA will not have any coding
03/08/2023, 7:51 pm - Aditeya Baral: You will have a project

03/08/2023, 8:05 pm - +91 99456 67559: Got in class group
03/08/2023, 8:06 pm - +91 80764 27750: <Media omitted>
03/08/2023, 8:07 pm - Aditeya Baral: * Proceeds to protest by showing up at 8 am *
03/08/2023, 8:07 pm - +91 6362 649 645: Only 2 ISA's
03/08/2023, 8:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: They are compensating for no classes during ISA weeks
03/08/2023, 8:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: That is why the increased class hours
03/08/2023, 8:08 pm - +91 84315 99055: So like all isas will be considered ?¿!!!🥲
03/08/2023, 8:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also your ISAs will be harder now
03/08/2023, 8:08 pm - Aditeya Baral: No best of something policy
03/08/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 94495 71975: Mega L 💀
03/08/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 73532 91375: During the commerce people orientation 
Jawahar sir was like 2 isa system, 4 units, and Isa will also be in hybrid mode like esa 
And no classes during ISA week 
I'm sure it's the same for us also
03/08/2023, 8:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: Plus, the content has remained the same, but they have been restructured from 5 units to 4 units for all courses
03/08/2023, 8:09 pm - +91 84315 99055: Thanks for that 🥲
03/08/2023, 8:09 pm - Aditeya Baral: So theoretically the content per ISA has comes 2.5 times what it used to be
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Which means that if you screw up a single ISA for a course you are screwing up 25% of your entire grade
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 84315 99055: F ☠️
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro why
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 90199 42460: Pls stop
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: (I can stop with the bad news)
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 94495 71975: Stop please
03/08/2023, 8:10 pm - +91 84315 99055: Is there anything left at this point 🥲

03/08/2023, 8:11 pm - +91 76187 12509: Now u scaring us brotha
03/08/2023, 8:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Also now no more MCQs - ISAs are apparently back to normal mix of MCQ + written questions
03/08/2023, 8:11 pm - +91 90199 42460: Bro ragging is not allowed

03/08/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 94495 71975: Well fuck💀
03/08/2023, 8:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Back then ISAs used to be crucial to maintaining a good grade
03/08/2023, 8:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Screwing one 1 ISA = S grade gone
03/08/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 91487 96705: Written paper ??
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: But on the other hand things wont be as hectic
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 86609 38836: What was the duration of such an ISA btw?
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not written, typed
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: On the computer only
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 72040 58969: How?
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 73532 91375: Now they were like isa also hybrid mode like esa
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ours was 1 hour
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 73532 91375: I think 1h
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 82968 47111: More time between ISA’s.
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - Aditeya Baral: Because with 5 ISAs you had an ISA every 2/3 weeks
Now an ISA is every 6 ish weeks
03/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 84315 27126: Yea, in that orientation
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 73532 91375: Yep
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 86609 38836: Because we now have 2.5 units per ISA so it still remains 1 he?
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 86609 38836: *hr
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: Again, wait for official info
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 99014 37680: We had this in our first year
was peaceful

only 2 ISAs
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: I am just stating from past experience what it used to be
03/08/2023, 8:14 pm - Aditeya Baral: They might increase the timings

03/08/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 73532 91375: It's reduced to 4 units 
So 2 units per isa
03/08/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 73532 91375: Yep🙏
03/08/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 73532 91375: That's what was told in the orientation
03/08/2023, 8:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: 2 units per ISA
But the content hasn't changed
03/08/2023, 8:15 pm - +91 77188 25988: Bruh moment
03/08/2023, 8:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: 5 units have been restructured into 4 units
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - +91 73532 91375: True
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: So dont think that syllabus has decreased
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: That is what I am saying
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - +91 86609 38836: I meant practically speaking prev 5 units now scaled down to 4 units
Still keeping it as 1 hr seems unfair
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - +91 73532 91375: We're in pes 
Everything is fair
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - +91 73532 91375: But again, let's wait for the orientation
03/08/2023, 8:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: Each ISA used to be 40 marks, 1 hour. About 20 questions per ISA btw
03/08/2023, 8:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: The first few questions used to be MCQs
03/08/2023, 8:17 pm - Aditeya Baral: The last 4-5 are typed questions
03/08/2023, 8:17 pm - +91 79753 44379: I used to leave home at 8☠️
03/08/2023, 8:18 pm - +91 97395 33665: @919686041205 were your classes also till 3:45 or was it normal 8:15-3:30??
03/08/2023, 8:18 pm - +91 80884 07523: 5 was too much, 3 would've been perfect but they always have to stand out from vtu in every way no matter how it affects the student
03/08/2023, 8:18 pm - Aditeya Baral: Mine were till 3:30
03/08/2023, 8:19 pm - +91 84315 27126: Also from 2nd yr did yall have all classes together or were there breaks in between?
03/08/2023, 8:19 pm - Aditeya Baral: Two breaks were there
03/08/2023, 8:19 pm - Aditeya Baral: We had 2 hours of class, break, 2 hours, lunch, 2 hours
03/08/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 86188 49484: Also we'll have projects for each subject right  at the end ?
03/08/2023, 8:20 pm - +91 84315 99055: We had that till last sem 🥲
03/08/2023, 8:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah
03/08/2023, 8:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Some have assignments
03/08/2023, 8:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Some have both
03/08/2023, 8:21 pm - +91 91082 65521: So only 4 units for all subjects?
03/08/2023, 8:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Looks like that
03/08/2023, 8:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Some also have labs
03/08/2023, 8:24 pm - +91 77188 25988: And the 5th unit is gonna be distributed among the other 4?
03/08/2023, 8:24 pm - +91 77188 25988: In other words, each unit is going to be bigger right?
03/08/2023, 8:24 pm - +91 84315 99055: Let's just expect the worse 🥲
03/08/2023, 8:25 pm - +91 75400 90995: How many MCQs probably?
03/08/2023, 8:27 pm - +91 91082 65521: 💀💀omg  tough time ahead

03/08/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 91132 16705: compensation
03/08/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 6361 631 974: Hmm makes sense actually
03/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 91132 16705: any official announcement yet?
03/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 91132 16705: about all this?

03/08/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 6361 631 974: I'm not saying it's right, also I was saying makes sense cuz I realized we have 2 isas and so no classes during that time
03/08/2023, 11:53 pm - +91 6361 631 974: 💀
04/08/2023, 12:26 am - +91 77188 25988: I mean c'mon. If it's gonna be just 2 ISA's, it's not practical to keep classes during the exams
04/08/2023, 12:27 am - +91 6361 631 974: He was talking about the compensation part not the classes part

04/08/2023, 1:14 am - +91 91087 96229: If I am building a UAV, I'm better off getting 5 hrs of classes a day than 8
04/08/2023, 1:14 am - +91 91087 96229: (Assuming there's no major hit to my marks, which their ofcourse won't be)
04/08/2023, 1:15 am - +91 91087 96229: The college doesn't even recognize the fact that u could be doing smrhg other than ISA ESA
04/08/2023, 1:15 am - +91 91087 96229: I talked to Ajoy the COO
When my dad asked him about this man straight up said
"If he isn't studying for ISAs or ESAs then what is he doing? He's watching Netflix right? What else could he possible be doing."
04/08/2023, 1:16 am - +91 91087 96229: Possibly*
04/08/2023, 1:16 am - +91 91087 96229: He wasn't sarcastic or joking or anything
04/08/2023, 1:16 am - +91 91087 96229: He fully believed those words
04/08/2023, 1:17 am - +91 91087 96229: 8 hrs of classes is straight up wrong
04/08/2023, 1:18 am - Aditeya Baral: Yeah but issue is then you dont meet the credit requirement set by college
04/08/2023, 1:18 am - Aditeya Baral: You need atleast a certain number of credits at the end of your BTech to be internationally counted for a 4-year Bachelors study

04/08/2023, 3:53 pm - +91 98230 59024: Because I know people who got an A with marks below 80
04/08/2023, 3:54 pm - +91 94495 71975: Below 80 overall or below 80 only in the esa

04/08/2023, 7:47 pm - +91 74112 64188: Well trained and experienced gym trainers .
04/08/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 74112 64188: Seperate changing rooms for men and women with a large number of lockers to cater to everyone's needs. Well maintained bathroom and washroom facilities.
04/08/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 74112 64188: Regular maintainence of gym by the support staff.
04/08/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 74112 64188: Hope thats enough.
04/08/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 77188 25988: Pretty good
04/08/2023, 8:04 pm - +91 77188 25988: ☝️
04/08/2023, 8:11 pm - +91 98230 59024: You got me convinced, I shall start gym from the first day of next year 🫡
04/08/2023, 8:13 pm - +91 74112 64188: 2024 ?
04/08/2023, 8:14 pm - +91 98230 59024: uh huh Jan 1 5:00 AM
04/08/2023, 8:22 pm - +91 77188 25988: You could start this Sem bruh
04/08/2023, 8:40 pm - +91 91088 24105: Is there a certain amount of time a person can stay or u can go whenever and come out whenever
04/08/2023, 8:42 pm - +91 77188 25988: The latter mostly
04/08/2023, 8:50 pm - +91 96061 40554: It's a bit messed up when there's a crowd. They have slots after 330. Before 330 you can come and go whenever and the place is mostly empty. Then there's 330-445,445-6,6-730. So even if you go at 345-4, they'll make you leave at 445 because that's when the slot ends. Also for some reason the trainers there refuse to spot you and they ask you to ask someone else to spot you. This can become a bit uncomfortable especially if you're alone and have to ask someone to spot you every few sets. These are the only drawbacks for the pesu gym
04/08/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 96061 40554: When there isn't much of a crowd then it's super chill even after 330
04/08/2023, 8:51 pm - +91 96061 40554: Also the equipment is excellent
04/08/2023, 8:52 pm - +91 96061 40554: And if you're not sure about your form you can feel free to ask the trainers and they'll help you out
04/08/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 96061 40554: All in all, if you're a hostellite then it'll be awesome for you. For day scholars like myself, it gets pretty hectic and doesn't really make sense logistically. This is also because they need you to carry separate shoes for the gym and a change of clothes everyday
04/08/2023, 8:56 pm - +91 87553 16048: What would be the reason to choose college gym for a dayscholar rather than the one close to where he live
04/08/2023, 8:57 pm - +91 96061 40554: This is also true. The excellent equipment makes the place look super attractive lmao
04/08/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 96061 40554: And maybe for some ppl there isn't a gym that's close by
04/08/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 90082 75026: technically reduces travel
04/08/2023, 8:58 pm - +91 96061 40554: So if they're going to do it then these will be the pros and cons
04/08/2023, 9:01 pm - +91 91088 24105: Thank you
04/08/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 90082 75026: with new college timings we gotta hope they change the gym timings too
04/08/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 87553 16048: Atleast there's somethin we can be proud of
04/08/2023, 9:02 pm - +91 90082 75026: coz college ending at 4 and next slot at 4:45 wont work
04/08/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 90082 75026: they might get rid of a slot entirely
04/08/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 96061 40554: True but then again they'll just introduce a different slot system to mitigate the crowd
04/08/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 90082 75026: coz trainers dont wanna stay after 7:30
04/08/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 96061 40554: I feel like it's unlikely because there are already a lot of ppl enrolled
04/08/2023, 9:03 pm - +91 96864 16124: They’ll prolly reduce the timings of each slot to one hour each or sm
04/08/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 96061 40554: It's gonna get super crowded if they do that
04/08/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 96061 40554: Yeah and this isn't enough for many

04/08/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 96061 40554: Only makes sense for hostellites lmao
04/08/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 96061 40554: And even then afterwards it'll be difficult to focus in class 😭😭😭
04/08/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 90082 75026: just to sleep till noon
04/08/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 74112 64188: Still  class @ 8  pretty hectic
04/08/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 96061 40554: Exactly 💀💀💀
04/08/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 77188 25988: Gym timings are manageable for hostelites and PG residents mostly
04/08/2023, 9:09 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lol the profs prolly hate this more than us
04/08/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 74112 64188: The gyms like a 5 min walk for me.
04/08/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 89054 72730: Bunk last 2 classes and go to gym
04/08/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 93537 16080: Biggest problem is probably carrying a towel and a change of clothes along with your regular college stuff
04/08/2023, 9:10 pm - +91 96061 40554: Yeah like bro imagine having worked so hard all your life to get a PhD and everything and then you get a job that demands you to reach the venue at 745 😭
04/08/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 77188 25988: Yeah cause you're a hostelite
04/08/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 90197 96534: Lol fax
04/08/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 90197 96534: Many people choose to become profs cuz u have to teach little bit and spend the rest of the time doing research
04/08/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 96061 40554: Yes you'll need a separate bag for that and it totally won't look like you're carrying a cash bribe for doredaddys subordinates
04/08/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 77188 25988: Or stay back in the evening 🗿
04/08/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 74112 64188: The cleaning staff definitely have it harder
04/08/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 96061 40554: But you'll still get the bag w you when you come to college if you're a day scholar
04/08/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 77188 25988: True
04/08/2023, 9:14 pm - +91 96061 40554: <Media omitted>

04/08/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 91087 96229: U aren't allowed to use chalk in the gym btw
04/08/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 91087 96229: That's the only L
04/08/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 91087 96229: And their is no pull down machine
04/08/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 74112 64188: You got lat pull downs
04/08/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 74112 64188: That too 2
04/08/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Chalk??
04/08/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 74112 64188: While lifting heavy you use it on your palms for better grip.
04/08/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 96057 85091: Not even liquid chalk ?
04/08/2023, 9:47 pm - +91 6366 682 139: How do you get grip then?? Sandpaper??
04/08/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 91087 96229: Bro not the cable machine
04/08/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 91087 96229: That is always being used by some idiot senior trying to do Hercules pillar hold
04/08/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 91087 96229: Nope
04/08/2023, 9:48 pm - +91 74112 64188: Chalks you need to ask permission . And get your own and clean the equipment yourself apparently.
04/08/2023, 9:49 pm - +91 91087 96229: Nah bro lmao
Basically u take chalk powder and apply it to ur palm
Heavy lifts It reduces risk of slipping
04/08/2023, 9:50 pm - +91 6366 682 139: No I mean if you're not allowed to use chalk in PES gym, how'd you get the grip??
04/08/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 96061 40554: You just grip it hard
04/08/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 96061 40554: If that isn't enough then chalk helps
04/08/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 96061 40554: If that isn't enough then you use lifting straps
04/08/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 91087 96229: <Media omitted>
04/08/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 91087 96229: which is not allowed in PES gym

04/08/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 96057 85091: I feel like if someone asked the higher authorities about chalk they might suggest this if u tell them u need something for grip
04/08/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 6366 682 139: No cap!!
04/08/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Imagine sanding your hands with sandpaper
04/08/2023, 10:00 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Later that same night
04/08/2023, 10:01 pm - +91 83107 58397: I asked them if I could pay for two slots so that I could workout for longer and they said no, I doubt they'll listen to you
04/08/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: the higher authorities dont care abt u
04/08/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: they will ask about ur ISA marks and attendance
04/08/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 91087 96229: if thats not good enough then u dont have to bother urself by using sandpaper on ur hands
they will use it themselves all over u

For those of you who don't know, WhatsApp has a group limit of 1025 participants, and this group is already full. We've got close to 80+ people waiting to join.
It would be great if the people in this group who are not from RR Campus(and not from BTech also, if any) would _leave the group_ in order to make space for the people who are actually supposed to be in this group. 
Ig there are many EC campus people also here...
So please take up the initiative to leave, else, _there is a chance that_ you might get removed..
Thank you. <This message was edited>

27/08/2023, 9:30 am - Aditeya Baral: Because as far as I know, it does not explicitly say anywhere that the scholarships are campus specific
27/08/2023, 9:38 am - +91 80884 07523: Both campuses get a separate list now

27/08/2023, 11:10 am - +91 6361 631 974: But like no fair to that guy

27/08/2023, 11:13 am - +91 80884 07523: Cnr is cgpa, mrd is sgpa
27/08/2023, 11:13 am - +91 6361 631 974: Oh shit ur right
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 6361 631 974: That makes a whole lot of sense now fuck
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 6361 631 974: 💀
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 6361 631 974: Welp
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 90197 96534: Even then shouldn't it be separate?
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 6361 631 974: No no
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 6361 631 974: It makes sense

27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 90197 96534: Like they should exclude people who r getting cnr?
27/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 80884 07523: They do
27/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 90197 96534: Oh ok
27/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 73532 91375: How did they calculate this in the 1st sem then?
27/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 80884 07523: Pes loves money too much to give people two scholarships
27/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 6361 631 974: Think about it this way, the guy who got 9.95 sgpa this sem might have gotten 8 in last sem and didn't make the cut for CNR

If they haven't informed anything about tomorrow then it's simple that we have college tomorrow
10/09/2023, 6:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: Usually PES doesn't care about strikes. Remember, this is the college that called kids in for exams during COVID

10/09/2023, 9:14 pm - +91 97418 00513: So basically they're against women getting free rides
10/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 97418 00513: Which is fair. If they want to give free rides, reserve or for the disabled, elderly, the poor, and students
10/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 77953 89834: Bro there’s college tomorrow, that’s it! End of story! 😂

10/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 6364 279 393: You sound really salty m8
10/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nah bro half the bus travellers are women. By giving them all free rides, the revenue is cut down by 4k crores in 4 years
10/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 97418 00513: That would reduce salaries lmao
10/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 97418 00513: It'd be great if they let us use metro cards in buses instead of me handing a 100 rupee note to him 😭
10/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 97418 00513: Is that what men said during #MeToo 😭

10/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 94495 71975: just get a bus pass
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Too late
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: No.
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 94495 71975: why not
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: I refuse to get another wallet with an extra slot to keep that pass😭
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 94495 71975: put it in ur id card man
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: My Wallet got 3 card slots and they're all full😤
10/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 97418 00513: Uh, my id card is in my wallet

10/09/2023, 9:22 pm - +91 97418 00513: Nah that's with a gay dude who jumped me outside a glory hole

10/09/2023, 9:23 pm - +91 78297 70134: I'm yet to see one text from you that isn't excruciatingly tmi
10/09/2023, 9:24 pm - +91 97418 00513: Bold of you to assume I'm mentally stable
10/09/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 96323 92436: that is what happens when the govt uses communist ideas
10/09/2023, 9:26 pm - +91 94495 71975: what happened to the leash thing that comes with the id card
10/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: Uh, no. It's not communist lol it's straight up vote banking. They promised free rides for women to get votes, like every other party does - make exaggerated promises and then don't execute them.

Congress, however, is getting raped by BJP every where and HAVE to keep their promises up so that they have a chance to win in other states and alongside I.N.D.I.A. else They're dead lmao.

This scheme was never feasible with the state budget they had. They had to execute it anyways else they'll never win in another state.
10/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 97418 00513: In my drawer
10/09/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 96323 92436: i fail to disagree

10/09/2023, 9:39 pm - +91 97418 00513: When did I say it's not my problem all I wanted to do was whine
10/09/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 90199 42460: bro let his intrusive thuoghts win
10/09/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 90662 02088: Will bmtc buses not run tom?
10/09/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 73532 91375: Imao ok

10/09/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 94495 71975: Yeah then use that to hold ur id card and hence u have an empty slot for bus pass 🫡
10/09/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 94495 71975: 🫢😥

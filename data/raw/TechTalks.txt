16/07/2023, 4:16 pm - +91 82966 49143: A chess board has 8 rows and 8 columns. A queen in chess can move rowwise, columnwise and diagonally. If a queen is placed at position (r, c), 1 <= r <= 8 and 1 <= c <= 8, write a C program to find all squares which are under control of the queen. Express each square as a pair of numbers ‚Äì row number and column number.
16/07/2023, 4:16 pm - +91 82966 49143: can anybody help solving this problem??
16/07/2023, 4:24 pm - +91 92050 03561: To find row wise controlled squares just iterate over each column on the same row as the queen
16/07/2023, 4:25 pm - +91 92050 03561: Similarly do it for the column wise controlled squares
16/07/2023, 4:26 pm - +91 92050 03561: For the diagonal use 2 nested for loops
16/07/2023, 4:45 pm - +91 91087 96229: Why would u use nested loops for the diagonals
16/07/2023, 4:47 pm - +91 99024 20654: because its C and you can' t multiply strings.
unless you wanna make recursive function calls
16/07/2023, 4:48 pm - +91 91087 96229: Why do u need to do thag
16/07/2023, 4:48 pm - +91 91087 96229: U realize rite
That the diagonals r still linear
16/07/2023, 4:49 pm - +91 91087 96229: for(int i=cur_row, j=cur_col; i<8 && j<8;++i, ++j)

16/07/2023, 4:49 pm - +91 81973 59871: Ye should be possible with out any complications
16/07/2023, 4:51 pm - +91 81973 59871: But how u gonna check for diagnol values
16/07/2023, 4:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: This
16/07/2023, 4:52 pm - +91 78928 96964: U don't even need two variables, one is sufficient
16/07/2023, 4:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: Yeah exactly
16/07/2023, 4:52 pm - +91 91087 96229: Just store delta
16/07/2023, 4:52 pm - +91 81973 59871: Ye ye got it check for equality
16/07/2023, 4:53 pm - +91 81973 59871: They will still be equal distances from either top or bottom edge so just check for the no. Matching
16/07/2023, 4:53 pm - +91 91087 96229: ```for (int del = 1; (cur_row+del)<8 && (cur_col+del)<8; ++del)```
16/07/2023, 4:53 pm - +91 81973 59871: Ahh
16/07/2023, 4:54 pm - +91 81973 59871: That's also a possibility
16/07/2023, 4:55 pm - +91 92050 03561: Works

but it‚Äôll miss 1,2 and also miss 1,4 and 3,1

16/07/2023, 5:55 pm - +91 99024 20654: the loop checks out but how do you actually print inside the loop though
16/07/2023, 5:55 pm - +91 99024 20654: how do you print a variable number of spaces
16/07/2023, 5:56 pm - +91 99024 20654: does printf have functionality to do that with some formatting shenanigans üíÄ
16/07/2023, 5:56 pm - +91 99024 20654: prolly does didn't think of that
16/07/2023, 5:58 pm - +91 91087 96229: ```const char *sp[]={"", " ", "  ", "   "};```

I can already tell that bad things will happen with me for using this method
16/07/2023, 5:58 pm - +91 91087 96229: sp[x] gives a string with x spaces
16/07/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 99024 20654: lmaooooo
16/07/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 96065 83508: ```
void sp(int x) {
    if(!x) return;
    printf(‚Äù ‚Äú);
    sp(‚Äîx);
}
```
16/07/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 99024 20654: my solution was to just do ```const char* sp = "                                                                      ";```
insert \0 at convenient index and just printf %s sp
16/07/2023, 6:01 pm - +91 96065 83508: ‚Äîx, i swear I had that in
16/07/2023, 6:02 pm - +91 91087 96229: ill do u one better

```const char *sp = "          \x00";```
16/07/2023, 6:02 pm - +91 91087 96229: sp[i] gives len-i spaces where len is the length of sp
16/07/2023, 6:02 pm - +91 96065 83508: gl with editing a const char*
16/07/2023, 6:02 pm - +91 99024 20654: what's the difference
16/07/2023, 6:02 pm - +91 99024 20654: two null bytes will be there

16/07/2023, 6:09 pm - +91 91087 96229: But why would you use an easy to understand, easily maintainable method to do something when you can use some messed up method that makes your code infinitely harder to maintain, but guarantees branchlessness
16/07/2023, 6:11 pm - +91 99024 20654: printf itself branches internally so no point üò¢

16/07/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 99024 20654: imagine using wrapper functions over syscalls
16/07/2023, 6:23 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: The very concept of stdout is a wrapper on the display driver, so...
16/07/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 99024 20654: stdout is a file abstraction over a stream which is sent to the shell which then sends it to the terminal which then sends it to the gpu which then renders the characters to a framebuffer which is then memory mapped onto the screen

18/07/2023, 3:41 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Just get a nerd font, put it in ~/.fonts/ - don't bother with cursor space - and then use fc-cache | grep to get the actual font name, and then save your i3 config
18/07/2023, 3:47 pm - +91 99024 20654: Oh real
18/07/2023, 3:47 pm - +91 99024 20654: I do the same but i put the fonts in ~/.local/share/fonts
18/07/2023, 3:53 pm - +91 96065 83508: The patching process destroys fonts (it messes up hinting) and also makes the font files rather large.
If you are only going to use the symbols in a terminal just download the nerdfonts standalone from here [1] and if the font fallback mechanism is not trash it will work seemlessly. You can also use any font that way, even your own with custom settings if you ever compile some on your own.

18/07/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 78928 96964: Fedora!!!
18/07/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 82177 03098: start with mint ubuntu or pop
18/07/2023, 9:51 pm - +91 99670 58974: Pop OS gives esasiest start
18/07/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 82177 03098: It just work
18/07/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 99168 84047: Ubuntu, it's beginner friendly

18/07/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 82177 03098: before we know it, we'll be retired
18/07/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 89518 77127: A surface level idea:
At boot time this one program called the bootloader essentially has to decide which OS to boot into.

If you choose windows, all the hardware on your device is initialised and the windows OS is loaded into ram and so only windows runs.
If you choose linux, the linux OS you installed is loaded and so only that runs.

so at any time only 1 OS is running so it has access to all the system resources, so no compromise in performance.
Only thing that is compromised is disk storage space because you have to store the 2 OSs on the same disk, and windows and linux use different file systems so those also have to exist separately etc
18/07/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 73384 78667: give me the best, idc about beginner friendly, I shall suffer and learn

18/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 82177 03098: linux is fine reading windows, windows cries like a baby reading linux partitions

18/07/2023, 9:54 pm - +91 97419 66168: Beginner friendly is any Ubuntu based distro since resources are better
18/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 93534 64282: Common micosoft L
18/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 97419 66168: As in youtuebtutorials

18/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 89518 77127: no such thing as best.. only based on what you prefer/ want to  do you choose a distro.

and to understand this, a beginner friendly distro is good to start off with because otherwise you'll get so overwhelmed you'll go back to being a windows normie

Use mint or PopOS. DONT INSTALL UBUNTU OR EVERYONE BEAT YOU
18/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 97419 66168: Arch has the best wiki
18/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 81974 45749: He is learning fast
18/07/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 99168 84047: The best is subjective

18/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 97419 66168: One word of advice for linux:

It may seem like you are overwhelmed with choice (and you are) but really, none of your choices matter because it all works
18/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 93534 64282: No issues i have a lot of family pictures and my dads business stuff on laptop i just dont want to lose those
18/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 81974 45749: Resources are straightforward
18/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 82177 03098: they will throw u into arch wiki and let u figure it out yourself
18/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 81974 45749: Yeah lol
18/07/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 97419 66168: And you change them all later if you don't like it
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 81974 45749: Back up the data
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 89518 77127: if you're doing your install without making backup also we all beat you
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 97419 66168: No
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 89518 77127: backup your data always kids
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 93534 64282: It is
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 97419 66168: Don't do arch
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 81974 45749: Eyyy they try man
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 82177 03098: as their resources are sTRAIGHT, THEY EXPECT U TO USE THE RESOURCES
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 81974 45749: Do arch
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 81974 45749: If you use rpm based any package manager distro
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 81974 45749: Gg
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 97419 66168: Arch people be like "you'll learn os" or some dumb shit but it's defo not easy
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 89518 77127: extremely, if you know what youre doing..
if you're a beginner then stay the hell away from arch lmao
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 97419 66168: It's not for everyone
18/07/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 81974 45749: Zypper is bottom of my list

18/07/2023, 9:58 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: If you're comfortable not having the most direct and clean install experience, pick pop
18/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 81974 45749: If you like thicc efi partitions*
18/07/2023, 9:58 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: If you're ready to embrace it as the journey it is and stumble and screw up on the way, use Arch
18/07/2023, 9:58 pm - +91 73384 78667: will arch make me cry?
18/07/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 89518 77127: anybody knows why popOS needs friggin 1gb efi? little excessive noe?

18/07/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 89518 77127: trust me if you're just ocming from windows then you'll feel like someone threw you naked in china with your hands and feet tied
18/07/2023, 10:02 pm - +91 81974 45749: Me and himank used to laugh so much cuz of the dumb shit we did

18/07/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 81974 45749: Linux makes life easier thats it
18/07/2023, 10:03 pm - +91 81974 45749: Period
18/07/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 81974 45749: If you want to use windows use
18/07/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 81974 45749: What's important is that you build things
18/07/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 73384 78667: so Linux>windows for dev anyday?
18/07/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 81974 45749: Ez
18/07/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 97419 66168: Yeah pretty much
18/07/2023, 10:04 pm - +91 81974 45749: Any unix based i'd say over win

18/07/2023, 10:05 pm - +91 81974 45749: Personally not a fan of mac for desktop
18/07/2023, 10:05 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Make your life easy so you can focus on getting a working system
18/07/2023, 10:05 pm - +91 96065 83508: I‚Äôd say for the same amount of money you get more computer if you buy an apple machine, and unless you‚Äôre gaming, M1 macs are a solid choice

18/07/2023, 10:05 pm - +91 81974 45749: Agreed
18/07/2023, 10:06 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Yes
18/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 89518 77127: once you're comfortable yes.. took me 6 months on pop and then I jumped into arch
18/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 81974 45749: You don't need to, its not a compulsion, its a choice

The free in free and open source software stands for freedom
18/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 81974 45749: Free as in freedom
18/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 97419 66168: You'll find out on your own, that's the fun part
18/07/2023, 10:06 pm - +91 97419 66168: And it's never that simple
18/07/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 82177 03098: But we will bully u to get to Linux, in that part u are not free
18/07/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 89518 77127: and honestly you can do any thing with any linux distro.. some people just like to obsess over the distro they use, if pop ends up doing whatever you need it to do, you dont need to even switch you can live in it forever.
18/07/2023, 10:07 pm - +91 81974 45749: Me omw to throw @917338478667 into the deep end: start writing kernel patches

"rm fr"
"aight lol go ahead"
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 82177 03098: Kids, this is a very good command to to in your Linux it speeds up your kernel :

sudo rm -rf /*
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 82177 03098: It makes your kernel 10 times faster
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 82177 03098: Remember this command
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 97419 66168: rf is bad
use fr fr
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 81974 45749: I saw this today
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 89518 77127: Fax this is my go to command.. try to get sudo password once youre in college and do it in all the systems, it'll make PES computers super useeable and fast
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 81974 45749: Chennu did rm -fr fr
18/07/2023, 10:10 pm - +91 81974 45749: And i was like

18/07/2023, 10:11 pm - +91 81974 45749: This is insanely fun to run on lab computers
18/07/2023, 10:11 pm - +91 81974 45749: The system speeds up so fast it deletes itself
18/07/2023, 10:11 pm - +91 81974 45749: Lmaoooo
18/07/2023, 10:11 pm - +91 89518 77127: look into it properly before you do tho.. you'll need to extend EFI partition and all it's little tricky for first time
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 82177 03098: I used some creepy ass tools that booted into its custom iso and moved partitions as a boot drive
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 82177 03098: EaseUS partition manager Pro cracked version
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 82177 03098: I still have it
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 89518 77127: what? some third party iso for installing?
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 82177 03098: It's easy very clean tho
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 82177 03098: No no, for moving my iso around
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 81974 45749: Lmfao what
18/07/2023, 10:12 pm - +91 89518 77127: "Pro"

sounds very windows paid and weak software type shit
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 97419 66168: Yes lmao
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 82177 03098: Cracked that's why
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 97419 66168: It fucked up my grub two days ago
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 82177 03098: U also used same?
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 89518 77127: wait why are y'al using that what
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 89518 77127: is parted not good enough :')
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 97419 66168: Moved the windows recovery part from the beginning to the end and fucked it up
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 82177 03098: That's fine, i rebuilt my grub later but it did resize and move my efi part
18/07/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 97419 66168: parted is kinda trash at moving parts
18/07/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 82177 03098: Parted cannot to the complex shit like moving and resizing efi stuff
18/07/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 97419 66168: And touching windows shit with linux is a bad idea
18/07/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 97419 66168: It can but you manually have to specify sector numbers
18/07/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 97419 66168: Scary shit if you have data on the line
18/07/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 89518 77127: fax.. anytime I have to move/resize efi or windows partitions i do it from windows installation media and diskpart
18/07/2023, 10:14 pm - +91 82177 03098: Bruh wtf, m human not computer
18/07/2023, 10:15 pm - +91 81974 45749: AGREED
18/07/2023, 10:15 pm - +91 81974 45749: HARD AGREE
18/07/2023, 10:15 pm - +91 89518 77127: fdisk? I end up using fdisk/cfdisk for stuff or gparted if it's some simple moving shit
18/07/2023, 10:15 pm - +91 82177 03098: TIL, but parted has a offline iso version? Cus even in live boot your efi is mounted and you cannot do anything then parts are mounted
18/07/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 81974 45749: Cfdisk best arch insta disk tool
18/07/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 82177 03098: When*
18/07/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 82177 03098: I use cgdisk usually for basic stuff not sure for this
18/07/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 97419 66168: Live boot means the efi part is on your usb
18/07/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 89518 77127: breh what üíÄ
18/07/2023, 10:16 pm - +91 89518 77127: ay no i dont think efi is mounted if youre in live env
18/07/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 82177 03098: Wait m confused
18/07/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 82177 03098: Cus i tired doing goarted for this task
18/07/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 89518 77127: goated
18/07/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 82177 03098: It kept saying partition busy
18/07/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 82177 03098: Sus
18/07/2023, 10:17 pm - +91 82177 03098: That's why I used this EaseUS crap
18/07/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 97419 66168: Honestly it's the best option
18/07/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 82177 03098: Maybe windows hibernation shit? Dunno
18/07/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 97419 66168: If you want to move unallocated space and shit
18/07/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 89518 77127: if you boot into live env then your SSD is not touched at all
18/07/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 89518 77127: everything happens off of the usb only
18/07/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 89518 77127: what did you have to do tho?
18/07/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 82177 03098: Move my efi from end to start and increase efi to 1 gb which required me to move all the partition to the right
18/07/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 89518 77127: oh yeah that fast startup ting in windows causes so many issues with network adapter and bluetooth adapters if you boot into linux directly after windows some weird shit it is
18/07/2023, 10:19 pm - +91 82177 03098: Yeahüò≠
18/07/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 89518 77127: can easily do this with gparted and diskpart sir.. done it so many times and ive never broken my install
18/07/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 82177 03098: Damn
18/07/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 97419 66168: bruh how
18/07/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 82177 03098: Diskpart I use always for resizing but it CANNOT move partition
18/07/2023, 10:20 pm - +91 97419 66168: Won't all your partition start sectors change?
18/07/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 97419 66168: That's what happened for me
18/07/2023, 10:21 pm - +91 97419 66168: Grub thought the linux part was a different number
18/07/2023, 10:22 pm - +91 99670 58974: What if the back up gets corrupted while restoring ü´†
18/07/2023, 10:22 pm - +91 99670 58974: (My APFS container got borked)
18/07/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 89518 77127: yes so this is what I do:

on windows:
use diskmgmt tool to shrink volume and create unallocated space

boot to linux:
use gparted and move unallocated space to start of the disk so its right next to efi.

boot to windows installatoin media, diskpart, delete old efi, create custom efi of 1gb size then bcdboot the new windows partition so this takes care of the new start sector and windows works now.

boot back to linux and fix off efi for your OS and ez
18/07/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 89518 77127: little bit messy proces jumping between windows and linux multiple times but it's worked 100% of the time for me
18/07/2023, 10:23 pm - +91 99670 58974: (He is a legend)
18/07/2023, 10:24 pm - +91 89518 77127: @919967058974 knows my luck with bcdboot XD

18/07/2023, 10:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: I'd prefer Kaggle only if that entire environment on which it runs gives no issues
18/07/2023, 10:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Otherwise usually if you're working with research code there is a 50% chance things won't work right off the bat
18/07/2023, 11:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: But there are workarounds usually so it's fine
18/07/2023, 11:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Colab is more convenient to setup things, but not having the overnight training is a big setback

19/07/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 99024 20654: Dragging the window by its titlebar should make it smol aain right
19/07/2023, 7:17 pm - +91 99024 20654: Maybe that could be a workaround for now

19/07/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 97419 66168: It's either because you have no titlebar in your kde settings
19/07/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 97419 66168: or more likely because of latte
19/07/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 97419 66168: You should turn off borderless maximized windows in latte settings
19/07/2023, 7:57 pm - +91 78388 85068: Yea

It has been the corner stone to humanity‚Äôs technological advancements, and its quest for knowledge.

If you want arch but dont want the pain that comes with setting it up; get EndeavourOS. I skimmed through in a virtual machine and it's super minimal;  it's pretty much vanilla arch but all the basic stuff configured and no useless bloat
12/08/2023, 10:19 am - +91 89518 77127: the whole setup process took the same amount of time it take to setup wifi and bluetooth on vanilla arch
12/08/2023, 10:20 am - +91 81974 45749: It breaks
12/08/2023, 10:20 am - +91 81974 45749: Just use arco linux instead
12/08/2023, 10:20 am - +91 81974 45749: Endeavour mirrors suck

12/08/2023, 10:29 am - +91 99670 58974: Your kernel is the same, Linux
12/08/2023, 10:30 am - +91 99670 58974: Your distro is on top of your kernel, like Debian mint pop arch arco etc
12/08/2023, 10:30 am - +91 89518 77127: also, small correction in terminology, the kernel is what linux is . it is not the entire OS. so no matter what distro of linux you use, the kernel will be the same, ie linux

12/08/2023, 10:32 am - +91 89518 77127: now it is major L
12/08/2023, 10:33 am - Aditeya Baral: After Ubuntu I used Kubuntu for a while
12/08/2023, 10:34 am - Aditeya Baral: And that's when my work stopped depending on what OS I was running
12/08/2023, 10:34 am - Aditeya Baral: So I moved to windows and wiped it xD

I have 2 drives and I kept Windows and Ubuntu on separate drives, so once in a few months I wipe it and install something new to try
12/08/2023, 10:35 am - +91 6362 176 909: I remember you saying that Hannah Montana distro is the best in reddit ü§£

12/08/2023, 10:35 am - Aditeya Baral: It is
12/08/2023, 10:35 am - Aditeya Baral: I used it for a week
12/08/2023, 10:35 am - +91 6362 176 909: I swear I searched it to see if you're actually serious
12/08/2023, 10:35 am - Aditeya Baral: Most unforgettable week of my life
12/08/2023, 10:37 am - +91 89518 77127: Wait that‚Äôs a real distro?
12/08/2023, 10:38 am - Aditeya Baral: https://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/
12/08/2023, 10:39 am - +91 89518 77127: Holy shit
12/08/2023, 10:39 am - +91 89518 77127: VM go brrrr
12/08/2023, 10:39 am - Aditeya Baral: Why VM
12/08/2023, 10:40 am - Aditeya Baral: Need to get the full feel of Miley Cyrus running your laptop
12/08/2023, 10:41 am - +91 96320 33996: From VMs just remembered has anyone here tired Qubes OS? Any reviews?
12/08/2023, 10:41 am - +91 96320 33996: Tried*
12/08/2023, 10:43 am - +91 96320 33996: Had this phase where I was really paranoid while working on my Kali vm, stumbled across it then..
12/08/2023, 10:46 am - +91 96320 33996: But didn't get any actual reviews. Kinda seems like an os for only really paranoid people üíÄ
12/08/2023, 10:46 am - +91 81974 45749: So you think people are lizards
12/08/2023, 10:47 am - +91 96320 33996: Yes?
12/08/2023, 10:48 am - +91 96320 33996: Pls don't cancel üôè
12/08/2023, 10:49 am - +91 99670 58974: LMFAO

12/08/2023, 10:51 am - Aditeya Baral: I identify as an owl thank you very much
12/08/2023, 10:52 am - +91 91488 72753: _"Always"_
12/08/2023, 10:53 am - +91 96320 33996: Does it come with a GUI installer? Asking for a friend üíÄ
12/08/2023, 10:54 am - +91 6362 176 909: Also does distro make a difference?
12/08/2023, 10:55 am - +91 97419 66168: Bruh i think this needs to go in the group desc
12/08/2023, 10:55 am - +91 97419 66168: Distro is essentially the package manager and default config
12/08/2023, 10:56 am - +91 97419 66168: You can mostly change the defaults, can't change the package manager
12/08/2023, 10:56 am - +91 97419 66168: Package manager doesn't really make a difference to the normal user either
12/08/2023, 10:56 am - +91 96320 33996: Ya ig this is one of the main differences
12/08/2023, 10:56 am - +91 97419 66168: So literally no real difference
12/08/2023, 10:56 am - +91 96320 33996: Desktop environments?
12/08/2023, 10:56 am - +91 97419 66168: Can change
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 99670 58974: Hmmm why not change package manager
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 97419 66168: Bruh you can change the literal kernel itself
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 96320 33996: Right
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 97419 66168: Then you're basically changing distro üíÄ
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 99670 58974: Bye bye apt hello pacman
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - Aditeya Baral: If you're a light user and aren't going into the finer details then not really. I've seen most people in my batch use Ubuntu right from first year to final year
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 97419 66168: It's like that philosophy ship thing
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 99670 58974: Hmmmmmm true
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 99670 58974: Ship of Theseus
12/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 99670 58974: XD
12/08/2023, 10:58 am - +91 96320 33996: Perfect lmao
12/08/2023, 10:58 am - +91 99670 58974: What separates a barebones arch system from a barebones Debian system is the package manager huh
12/08/2023, 10:58 am - +91 96320 33996: .....
12/08/2023, 10:58 am - +91 96320 33996: Installation?
12/08/2023, 10:58 am - +91 99670 58974: I mean makes sense what else is there that is different
12/08/2023, 10:59 am - +91 99670 58974: Debian is possible to install in the Arch Linux WayTM too
12/08/2023, 10:59 am - +91 96320 33996: Makes sense
12/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 96065 83508: I mean the difference in how software is shipped to you is a pretty big difference. It governs what assumptions of the system other applications can make
12/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 99670 58974: Cause the steps in the arch install are literally 
Create live environment
Partition
Build local environment from scratch
12/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 97419 66168: Linux has an almost standard way of dealing with this
12/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 97419 66168: Even applications compiled from source work correctly
12/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 97419 66168: You might actually miss some packages if your distro isn't popular or something, but you are mostly using debian/arch
12/08/2023, 11:02 am - +91 99670 58974: Pretty much the widest two base distros <This message was edited>
12/08/2023, 11:03 am - +91 99670 58974: Then there‚Äôs Fedora/RPM based distros
12/08/2023, 11:03 am - +91 99670 58974: Demn..
So your package manager is what separates your Linux distro

Revelation fr rn
12/08/2023, 11:05 am - +91 89518 77127: yes it does lmao
12/08/2023, 11:07 am - +91 96065 83508: I think you‚Äôve misunderstood. A lot of software (especially old and well established ones) provide a lot of build time options. Whether you want to statically link or dynamically link certain libraries, if dynamically linked then will they be shipped by default or you‚Äôll have to separately install them. And the configuration of the thing itself, like wasm support, additional lib support, etc.

Arbitrary package managers can do arbitrary things and they might not be compatible with each other.
12/08/2023, 11:07 am - +91 96065 83508: They might even have their own fork of something for their own distro
12/08/2023, 11:09 am - +91 89518 77127: yeee hehe
package manager is what defines how the binaries are linked, cache for the packages and build files etc are managed. You can change package manager also but its annoying and not all package managers will work on all distro
12/08/2023, 11:10 am - +91 89518 77127: hater.
watch me change from linux to linux-lts hah
12/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 99670 58974: Bro then what‚Äôs the secret sauce that separates Debian from Arch, there is nothing else that‚Äôs different
12/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 96320 33996: <Media omitted>
12/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 99670 58974: > not all package manager will not work on all distro
What is a distro, truly
12/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 99670 58974: :0
12/08/2023, 11:12 am - +91 99670 58974: If not the prepackaged components
12/08/2023, 11:12 am - +91 89518 77127: oh it is that, but how they're built on top of the base kernel is what sets them apart
12/08/2023, 11:12 am - +91 99670 58974: Take Debian, you have apt and the kernel and baaaaaasic utilities 
Take arch, you have Pac-Man, the kernel and baaaaaasic utilities (which you install manually)
12/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 89518 77127: I could be wrong coz not looked too much into it, but its like pacstrap sets up the distro on top of kernel in a certain way. 
using apt on that might not get you the same results because apt works differently from pacman
12/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 89518 77127: also the release model is a lamjor one
12/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 89518 77127: Debian released stable builds every so often.. Arch is rolling release
12/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 89518 77127: pacman is a package manager meant for rolling release models.. apt is one for stable release.. so I think that also plays a role
12/08/2023, 11:17 am - +91 81974 45749: prolly a bit more nuanced than that
12/08/2023, 11:17 am - +91 81974 45749: incl how pacman caches stuff
12/08/2023, 11:18 am - +91 89518 77127: yes for sure
12/08/2023, 11:18 am - +91 89518 77127: ye mentioned the caching here^
12/08/2023, 11:18 am - +91 99670 58974: So..
12/08/2023, 11:18 am - +91 99670 58974: It‚Äôs again
12/08/2023, 11:18 am - +91 99670 58974: The package manager
12/08/2023, 11:18 am - +91 81974 45749: ah
12/08/2023, 11:19 am - +91 89518 77127: yes
12/08/2023, 11:19 am - +91 89518 77127: or maybe
12/08/2023, 11:19 am - +91 89518 77127: prolly more complicated than that im dum hehe
12/08/2023, 11:19 am - +91 99670 58974: And the package manager in the live environment
12/08/2023, 11:21 am - +91 96065 83508: ye and packaging is really important.

Taking abhinav‚Äôs point on just compiling it from source.
Say you‚Äôd been using neovim 0.8 for a long time and now want to upgrade to 0.10. You clone the repository and run cmake and then install it. But now when you open it you get a long error message. You read it and it makes no sense. You read it more carefully and its something about some tree-sitter query not working. So you update the tree-sitter parsers, still don‚Äôt work. You update the queries and still doesn‚Äôt work, oh but that‚Äôs coz treesitter itself is out of date and so on.

That a lot of time wasted. Having a good package manager is important if you want things to work.
12/08/2023, 11:21 am - +91 81974 45749: so dependency management
12/08/2023, 11:22 am - +91 96065 83508: indeed
12/08/2023, 11:22 am - +91 89518 77127: ah ye smajor one
12/08/2023, 11:22 am - +91 89518 77127: also one more thing, isnt fedora and arch also all GNU/Linux?
12/08/2023, 11:23 am - +91 89518 77127: coz is debian fedora arch etc are all GNU/Linux then they're pretty much the same thing and then it would make sense that the package manager and other such software is what sets distros apart
12/08/2023, 11:24 am - +91 99670 58974: Exactly ü´†
12/08/2023, 11:24 am - +91 89518 77127: ive not looked into it so idk if anything other than GNU even exists
12/08/2023, 11:26 am - +91 89518 77127: that's why they say no man linux is linux..

why people prefer different distros is coz people had different directioksn in mind for where they wanted to take GNU/Linux

some wanted the stable release model with some other tings -> Debian was born
rolling release and full community chadness -> Arch esketit
whatever reason -> fedora 

then these communities started making software and packaging them for each of these distros independantly

so as time kept passing, the packages availability also prolly becase a major factor for why people choose a distro over the other
12/08/2023, 11:27 am - +91 89518 77127: so wait essentially Fedora debian arch is all the same? bruh this is some QFT, higgs field type shit. "everything is just energy and waves"
12/08/2023, 11:28 am - +91 89518 77127: Linux vs BSD should be real debate
12/08/2023, 11:28 am - +91 89518 77127: wait does anyone  in college actually use BSD?
12/08/2023, 11:28 am - +91 81974 45749: idts lol
12/08/2023, 11:29 am - +91 99670 58974: Bro that‚Äôs what I was going for, ‚Äúchange package manager to change the distro?‚Äù
12/08/2023, 11:29 am - +91 99670 58974: Give example
12/08/2023, 11:29 am - +91 99670 58974: I guess Darwin macOS is BSD
12/08/2023, 11:29 am - +91 89518 77127: yes it is damn it makes sense now whoa
12/08/2023, 11:29 am - +91 89518 77127: Linux kernel is written in GNU extended C. not in standard C
12/08/2023, 11:30 am - +91 89518 77127: so linux kernel you want to use meaning you're GNU/Linux by default

and all those distros use linux so they're all the same
12/08/2023, 11:30 am - +91 96320 33996: There are alternatives to GNU uh?
12/08/2023, 11:31 am - +91 81974 45749: yes
12/08/2023, 11:31 am - +91 99670 58974: > Apple Inc.'s macOS, with its Darwin base including a large amount of code derived from FreeBSD
12/08/2023, 11:31 am - +91 81974 45749: musl

12/08/2023, 11:32 am - +91 89518 77127: oh wow damn
12/08/2023, 11:32 am - +91 89518 77127: what does the darwin part mean tho?
12/08/2023, 11:32 am - +91 89518 77127: This message was deleted
12/08/2023, 11:33 am - +91 89518 77127: Where is Kiran with his gigantic repository of knowledge

> It uses its own package manager called apk, the OpenRC init system, script driven set-ups
12/08/2023, 11:33 am - +91 99670 58974: Darwin is the name of the macOS kernel lol
12/08/2023, 11:33 am - +91 89518 77127: @919606583508 does this make sense hehe
12/08/2023, 11:34 am - +91 99670 58974: My brother it‚Äôs not arch it‚Äôs GNU/Linux kernel
12/08/2023, 11:34 am - +91 89518 77127: oh right no XD
wait I change
12/08/2023, 11:34 am - +91 89518 77127: <Media omitted>
12/08/2023, 11:36 am - +91 96065 83508: Yes it does! That would also explain a lot of diversity within software in general. Why we have different terminals, different chat platforms, cryptography implementations, etc.

12/08/2023, 7:28 pm - +91 97419 66168: Zypper is the package management tool used in openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise distributions. While it shares similarities with other package managers like Pacman, it also has some unique features and capabilities:

    SAT Solver: Zypper employs a powerful dependency solver called the SAT (Satisfiability) solver. This solver ensures that package installations, upgrades, and removals meet all dependencies and constraints, resolving complex dependency issues effectively.

    Modular Repositories: Zypper supports the use of modular repositories, allowing users to choose specific module versions for installation. This enhances flexibility and enables users to select the appropriate package versions for their system.

    User-Friendly Interface: Zypper offers a user-friendly command-line interface with intuitive commands and options. It provides detailed information about package dependencies, versions, and repositories.

    Repo Management: Zypper allows easy management of software repositories. Users can add, remove, enable, disable, and prioritize repositories with simple commands.

    Vendor Changes: Zypper can handle vendor changes, which occur when packages from different vendors offer the same files. It provides options to accept or reject such changes during package installation or updates.

    Package Locking: Zypper enables users to lock specific packages to prevent them from being upgraded. This is useful when you want to maintain a specific package version for compatibility reasons.

    Patches and Updates: Zypper efficiently manages system patches and updates, making it easier to keep your system up to date and secure.

    System Snapshots: Zypper can create and manage system snapshots using the Btrfs file system's snapshot feature. This allows users to revert their system to a previous state if needed.

    Transaction Management: Zypper provides transaction-related commands that allow users to view, commit, or undo package management transactions, improving the overall reliability of package operations.

    Package Selection: Zypper supports various package selection options, such as specifying patterns (groups of packages) and using wildcards in package names.

    Delta RPMs: Zypper supports the use of delta RPMs, which contain only the differences between two package versions. This reduces the amount of data transferred during updates.

These extra features make Zypper a versatile and capable package manager for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise distributions, offering users advanced options for managing software packages and system updates.

17/08/2023, 11:55 pm - +91 81974 45749: You'll not understand much honestly, it depends on the level of talks they choose
17/08/2023, 11:55 pm - +91 73384 78667: Fair enough
17/08/2023, 11:56 pm - +91 78388 85068: 1 person speaks

17/08/2023, 11:56 pm - +91 73384 78667: Ah right, why would one need a laptop in that situation either?
17/08/2023, 11:57 pm - +91 78388 85068: cause why not
17/08/2023, 11:57 pm - +91 73384 78667: Ukw, good point
17/08/2023, 11:58 pm - +91 96065 83508: Large gathering of folks where they meet once in I don't know when to exchange things they've been working on.

Think math conferences, physics conferences, etc.

They are usually more serious as well from what I gather from YouTube recordings.
17/08/2023, 11:59 pm - +91 73384 78667: Makes sense, so it's a lot more technical and formal than a meet-up?
18/08/2023, 12:00 am - +91 96065 83508: Ye, But! I've never been to a conference, so take that with a grain of salt. These meetups by FOSS United are very casual, you'll meet a lot of like minded people. <This message was edited>

18/08/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 99670 58974: Simple volume is that blue bar on top (if I remember correctly)
Spanned volume/Logical volume (either one of two) is the yellow bar on top
18/08/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 94488 26746: I had made it accidentally simple volume.. Is there no way to go back to primary?
18/08/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 94488 26746: Ok
18/08/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 99670 58974: Primary partition is separate from that I think
18/08/2023, 9:37 pm - +91 94488 26746: Ohok
18/08/2023, 9:38 pm - +91 78388 85068: maybe that's causing the problem?

23/08/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 94488 26746: Thank you so much... Something is better than nothing for now lol
23/08/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 96320 33996: Hehe
23/08/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 73389 36843: Or even just live boot
23/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 94488 26746: That's not working too <This message was edited>
23/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 88672 19961: Honestly, yes
23/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 73389 36843: Unfortunate, what does it say?
23/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 96320 33996: Actually azure gives free services upto a limit that's prolly more than sufficient
23/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 96065 83508: It might be faster to just run it on your local computer. If you can detail your exact problem
23/08/2023, 11:07 pm - +91 92050 03561: Not that great tbh
23/08/2023, 11:07 pm - +91 92050 03561: Definitely better than a Victus
23/08/2023, 11:08 pm - +91 94488 26746: Afaik, I shud use Rufus right? So when I run it, what I do is basically turn off PC and boot PC from that pendrive, it does not recognize the partition
23/08/2023, 11:08 pm - +91 89518 77127: 5800H is a few years old at this point.. you should be able to find Ryzen 7000 series in the same price point
23/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 73389 36843: What laptop is it, what kinda BIOS do you have, also have you tried using balena etcher?
23/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 99024 20654: Icarus recommending etcher
23/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 73389 36843: Unfortunate

23/08/2023, 11:11 pm - +91 99024 20654: Ooh which gen? Do you know if it supports uefi?
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 94488 26746: In companies [when we get *internship[*], do companies allow us to use computers or we shud use/bring ours?
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 99024 20654: Gotta select mbr / gpt in rufus based on this
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 94488 26746: it does support UEFI
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 94488 26746: Oh okay
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 88672 19961: To flash your iso, yes. 
Also, secure boot is disabled right?
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 94488 26746: ye
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 99024 20654: you should seleft the gpt option
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 99024 20654: Mbr is the default option
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 96065 83508: It's probably because the boot priorities prioritise the hdd/SSD.

I had a similar problem, I just changed the priorities in the bios
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 94488 26746: okay I will do that
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 73389 36843: Also check boot priority
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 73389 36843: For usb
23/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yes
23/08/2023, 11:13 pm - +91 94488 26746: Ahh okay I will check on that
23/08/2023, 11:13 pm - +91 89518 77127: +1
23/08/2023, 11:13 pm - +91 94488 26746: For now, I will try this
23/08/2023, 11:13 pm - +91 89518 77127: Try kiran's suggestion first
23/08/2023, 11:13 pm - +91 94488 26746: yep doing one sec
23/08/2023, 11:13 pm - +91 89518 77127: shortest and probably the solution you need assuming your ISO was flashed correctly <This message was edited>

23/08/2023, 11:22 pm - +91 99024 20654: Select iso, change mbr to gpt
23/08/2023, 11:22 pm - +91 99024 20654: For uefi, ye
23/08/2023, 11:23 pm - +91 89518 77127: ayyy Sriprad has spoken gg GPT it is

23/08/2023, 11:37 pm - +91 89518 77127: hasnt happened to me yet so all I can say is skill issue to those that did break their systems
23/08/2023, 11:37 pm - +91 94488 26746: Arch is best known for least ram consumption is all I know
23/08/2023, 11:38 pm - +91 89518 77127: Oh funny thing about this..


Remember I sent a screenshot of BOSS linux the otherday lmao
23/08/2023, 11:38 pm - +91 89518 77127: it was taking up only 200mb of ram @_@

even base arch takes like 400
23/08/2023, 11:38 pm - +91 89518 77127: I dont even know how, it had a full DE and all
23/08/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 82177 03098: Damn
23/08/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 96065 83508: Base antiX uses 146, no DE though just a WM
23/08/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 89518 77127: And they have their own repositories for packages. Running the install command didnt pull ANYTHING from official ubuntu repos. it was all BOSS' own
23/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 89518 77127: that's why neofetch installation also was a pain the other day
23/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 96065 83508: Actually no, it also had a full on DE
23/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 89518 77127: oh damnn

Antix based on what?
23/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 96065 83508: Debian :)
23/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 89518 77127: good shit
23/08/2023, 11:40 pm - +91 96065 83508: And packages actually work xD
23/08/2023, 11:41 pm - +91 89518 77127: the shade XD
23/08/2023, 11:41 pm - +91 96065 83508: Base arch is like one tty
23/08/2023, 11:41 pm - +91 89518 77127: yeah
23/08/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 89518 77127: Arch doesnt care optimise for ram usage if im not wrong
23/08/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 6362 176 909: Mujhe kya me wsl use kar rha hu
23/08/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 89518 77127: Arch philosophy is "I have ram, I will use ram"
23/08/2023, 11:42 pm - +91 96065 83508: I see interesting
23/08/2023, 11:54 pm - +91 99024 20654: *8 :)
23/08/2023, 11:55 pm - +91 99024 20654: I read this in their docs but i didn't find anything that it does differently from other distros in this aspect lol
23/08/2023, 11:55 pm - +91 99024 20654: Maybe minor skill issue on my part
23/08/2023, 11:56 pm - +91 99024 20654: Void however, hits 83mb on tty beat that. 150 max with wm + statusbar + alacritty ü§©
23/08/2023, 11:57 pm - +91 89518 77127: wth
23/08/2023, 11:57 pm - +91 89518 77127: show proof or it didnt happen
23/08/2023, 11:58 pm - +91 89518 77127: idk either but ive noticed this for sure.. Arch doesnt free up ram as easily as pop(or debian) would..

I close many tabs and my ram usage would still hover quite high. it only reclaims when I launch something that actually needs that much space.
24/08/2023, 12:04 am - +91 99024 20654: I think i might aready have lol idr

24/08/2023, 12:47 am - +91 81974 45749: Works for me, it has for a year
24/08/2023, 12:53 am - +91 73389 36843: Make your own one, nvim-lsp
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Ye can do that too
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 82478 57046: i dont want to
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 82478 57046: I am too lazy
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Personally cba to do
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 82478 57046: ^
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Same lel
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 73389 36843: Use plug, takes 10 mins
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Ah yeah
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 73389 36843: Use docs man
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 82478 57046: me too lazy
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Yeah I mean _anyways_ I ended up writing part of my own config lmfao even despite astronvim
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 82478 57046: I just got used to some defaults
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Imagine reading docs
24/08/2023, 12:54 am - +91 82478 57046: and a _few_ custom binfs
24/08/2023, 12:55 am - +91 81974 45749: Then astronvim + keybinds and some plugs you can setup on own
24/08/2023, 12:55 am - +91 81974 45749: And yeah same ig i just got used to it
24/08/2023, 12:56 am - +91 73389 36843: My favorite plugin is vim org mode üòé

24/08/2023, 12:56 am - +91 81974 45749: The only major change i've made rn is remapping caps to ctrl
24/08/2023, 12:56 am - +91 73389 36843: Yeah I haven't changed anything since the first installation
24/08/2023, 12:56 am - +91 81974 45749: Caps acts as ctrl when held, esc when tapped
24/08/2023, 12:56 am - +91 81974 45749: Yeah it feels odd to change when you hit that sweet spot
24/08/2023, 12:57 am - +91 73389 36843: Yep. Just works, best to leave it as is
24/08/2023, 12:57 am - +91 81974 45749: Yes
24/08/2023, 12:57 am - +91 81974 45749: Focus on writing code more that way, less fuss about config
24/08/2023, 12:58 am - +91 81974 45749: As i've used linux more and more I'm less and less particular about things except for a few non negotiables

24/08/2023, 12:58 am - +91 82478 57046: I used to be wayy more opinionated
24/08/2023, 12:58 am - +91 81974 45749: That being i3 with my keybinds and nvim, altho I am open to vscode with vim mode
24/08/2023, 12:58 am - +91 81974 45749: Yeah lol
24/08/2023, 12:58 am - +91 82478 57046: Now I am happy if upgrade happens without headache
24/08/2023, 12:58 am - +91 81974 45749: Sadly I could never figure out vscode for some reason üíÄ
24/08/2023, 12:59 am - +91 82478 57046: And Nvidia doesn't break
24/08/2023, 12:59 am - +91 82478 57046: I am just tired of constant churn

24/08/2023, 12:59 am - +91 73389 36843: So true. Once it works, never bother messing with it. If it breaks more time is wasted fixing it so just have one config
24/08/2023, 12:59 am - +91 82478 57046: In both Linux, windows and osx
24/08/2023, 12:59 am - +91 81974 45749: Very odd, I never managed to open that command palette lmao I found it to be very very in the way of me doing work, I was reccomended zen mode tho may try

24/08/2023, 1:00 am - +91 82478 57046: And for the engineers at aapl, msft or the hoighty toity people of gnome
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 81974 45749: Honestly I wanna focus more on writing code than being 1% more riced
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 81974 45749: Lmao that gnome shade
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 73389 36843: Keybinds are actually the only thing that truly makes the workflow faster
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 82478 57046: To keep changing for getting the bonus that uear
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 81974 45749: Yeah
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 73389 36843: Everything else is just preference
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 73389 36843: I can live without those
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 81974 45749: I _love_ my keybinds and am very specific about them
24/08/2023, 1:01 am - +91 82478 57046: Yee
24/08/2023, 1:02 am - +91 82478 57046: Keybinds ftw

24/08/2023, 9:13 am - Aditeya Baral: Have you tried using conda? How are you installing?
24/08/2023, 9:15 am - +91 93538 20323: no, I've just used pip3, so I should use a virtual env?
24/08/2023, 9:15 am - Aditeya Baral: I'd suggest using conda firstly to manage your envs

Secondly, PyTorch has a very clean guide to installing the package: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
24/08/2023, 9:16 am - +91 93538 20323: okay, thankss

24/08/2023, 9:50 am - +91 96065 83508: Hmm there is a 3.9 wheel, what does pip say when it tries to install it?
24/08/2023, 9:52 am - Aditeya Baral: It's honestly not recommended to work with Python without envs. Especially if you're planning to work with ML workloads
24/08/2023, 9:53 am - +91 96065 83508: Indeed I don't disagree

If you didn't know, Leslie Lamport also invented LaTeX and Paxos
24/08/2023, 7:38 pm - +91 96065 83508: AWIL that TeX was created by Knuth, while LaTeX was by Leslie Lamport. Different softwares apparently
24/08/2023, 8:01 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Yep, yep
24/08/2023, 8:02 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Knuth's TeX was literally an algorithm to make printed text look good that became a typesetting system

24/08/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 94488 26746: What is polymorphism and inheritance In C++?
24/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 97419 66168: Did you try looking it up?
24/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 94488 26746: unable to understand
24/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 97419 66168: What didn't you understand
24/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 97419 66168: Classes are quite complex
24/08/2023, 11:07 pm - +91 97419 66168: It'll take you a bit to wrap your head around oop

24/08/2023, 11:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: Like, where exactly is this Inheritance concept in C++ used in real life?
24/08/2023, 11:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: yepp
24/08/2023, 11:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: yep doing that
24/08/2023, 11:08 pm - +91 94488 26746: Any best resources to learn C++ guys?
24/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 97419 66168: Inheritance is when a "class" inherits properties and behaviours from another, let's call it "parent", class
24/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 97419 66168: Like how humans are mammals
24/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 94488 26746: yes
24/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 97419 66168: Humans have specific traits
24/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 94488 26746: yep
24/08/2023, 11:09 pm - +91 97419 66168: But also more general traits all mammals have
24/08/2023, 11:10 pm - +91 94488 26746: Those traits can be either inherited or their own?!
24/08/2023, 11:10 pm - +91 97419 66168: These are shared between all classes that have mammal as their parent class
24/08/2023, 11:10 pm - +91 94488 26746: Is that the analogy we are going at...
24/08/2023, 11:10 pm - +91 97419 66168: Yes
24/08/2023, 11:10 pm - +91 94488 26746: okay
24/08/2023, 11:10 pm - +91 94488 26746: Hmm okay
24/08/2023, 11:11 pm - +91 94488 26746: Kinda clear now
24/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 96202 50004: Dem dude open a yt channel
24/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 96202 50004: üëçüëç
24/08/2023, 11:12 pm - +91 96065 83508: Say you have some type. Say a TcpStream. Now it holds state and has a bunch of methods that can modify that state. 

So you might have a `connect()` method, a `listen()` method, `parse _headers()` method and so on. The members hold the packet in a structured way.

But these methods are not specific to TCP. You can have it for UDP, for HTTP. In general its true for a network interface. So you might have a NetworkInterface virtual class that has those methods and TCP, HTTP all inherit from this class. You implement those methods for these particular classes based on how their format is specified <This message was edited>

24/08/2023, 11:15 pm - +91 91488 72753: What in ns3? 5g lena simulation?
24/08/2023, 11:15 pm - +91 94488 26746: yes bro, too less resources. All videos are like 8 years old xD.
24/08/2023, 11:15 pm - +91 94488 26746: No, the network simulator, Discrete one using C++ <This message was edited>

24/08/2023, 11:18 pm - +91 94488 26746: i am using for like this Hidden node problem in Wireless LAN. u have heard of this?
24/08/2023, 11:19 pm - +91 91488 72753: Hmm, not really familiar with that. What're you up to? Capstone or just a regular project?
24/08/2023, 11:19 pm - +91 94488 26746: Project under IEEE ComSoc, guided by the ~unguding~ external mentors and internal mentor on Sabbatical leave
24/08/2023, 11:19 pm - +91 94488 26746: We are kinda stranded now
24/08/2023, 11:20 pm - +91 91488 72753: Classic mid sem sabbatical, the biggest perk of tenure academics
24/08/2023, 11:20 pm - +91 91488 72753: Truly sad
24/08/2023, 11:20 pm - +91 91488 72753: I'd reach out to ns-3 users, i did that and it helped

25/08/2023, 11:55 am - +91 91233 35899: U wanted to talk to HSP ECC head yesterday. @918867219961 @918762354645 HSP ECC heads
25/08/2023, 11:57 am - +91 88672 19961: Hi suraj :) 
Welcome to tech talks.
25/08/2023, 12:02 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yes thanks a lot! I shall speak to them
25/08/2023, 12:03 pm - +91 78388 85068: @918867219961 is this the group for hsp ec too?
25/08/2023, 12:03 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: There's no "group" for hsp ec
25/08/2023, 12:03 pm - +91 6366 682 139: This message was deleted
25/08/2023, 12:03 pm - +91 82177 03098: Wat no!
25/08/2023, 12:03 pm - +91 82177 03098: This grp is not connected to hsp ec in anyway
25/08/2023, 12:03 pm - +91 82177 03098: We don't have a public facing grp for hsp ec sadly
25/08/2023, 12:04 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But yeah the Discord server is open to all
25/08/2023, 12:04 pm - +91 6366 682 139: And it is common for both RR and EC
25/08/2023, 12:04 pm - +91 88672 19961: No xD
HSP ECC has a community, but it's not open to all at the moment
25/08/2023, 12:04 pm - +91 6366 682 139: We have given it a new look with many channels, roles and onboarding
25/08/2023, 12:05 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: EC core and mentors aren't on the discord server, if you want to reach out to them, make sure you join the homebrew FOSS discord!
25/08/2023, 12:05 pm - +91 87623 54645: @918197445749 is one of the mentor team heads of HSP and he started this group <This message was edited>
25/08/2023, 12:05 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Damn could you send me the link??
25/08/2023, 12:06 pm - +91 88672 19961: @919967058974
25/08/2023, 12:09 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Also EC peeps you might not know this:

HackerSpace RR is rebooting, and as a part of it, we have created a website "The Ultimate Guide to PESU". This website has all the information about all the campuses of PESU. General info and RR Campus info is being added consistently, but no one has come forward to add information about EC campus, despite many requests.

Therefore, I request all of you to add as much as information you can about ECC, so that it will help current students and freshers alike.

Website: https://hackerspace-pesu.github.io/pesu-for-dummies/

GitHub repository: https://github.com/HackerSpace-PESU/pesu-for-dummies

25/08/2023, 12:27 pm - +91 97406 06511: it's time ü§òüèª
25/08/2023, 12:30 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Why don't we combine both the campuses in Homebrew FOSS?? Now that HackerSpace RR is revived, we have already created many open-source projects under the GitHub organisation. If we merge the campuses and add all the projects in one place, we can contribute to them together.

After all, at the end of the day, PESts are divided by campuses but united by passion..
25/08/2023, 12:35 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: An interesting proposal for sure! 

I don't think a full merge is feasible, but because it's open source, there's never been any campus-wise restriction on participating in homebrew activities, be it the workshops through hsp ecc or the discord server, so all are welcome to join the server when we put the link out, and start discussing there :)
25/08/2023, 12:38 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: after all, the content on the homebrew website and the community we've been building in EC Campus is the product of the hard work of HSP EC core and other homebrew members, so they should get due credit for that
25/08/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Ahh okay

Thanks!
25/08/2023, 12:38 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I shall convey the message to HackerSpace RR 
25/08/2023, 12:39 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: please do

25/08/2023, 12:44 pm - +91 80953 11996 joined using this group's invite link
25/08/2023, 12:44 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: I think there's already a website for hackerspace RR
25/08/2023, 12:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: I don't think Suraj here conveyed it correctly xD
25/08/2023, 12:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: So essentially what they want to do is revive an OSS community at RE
25/08/2023, 12:45 pm - Aditeya Baral: Unfortunately with PESOS dying out and nobody willing to revive it at the moment, there is nobody there to drive the initiative
25/08/2023, 12:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: So we wanted you all to expand HomeBrew's presence to RR and include this campus as well in your activities, events etc and so on
25/08/2023, 12:46 pm - Aditeya Baral: Since there is an active team at the moment at RR, they can also support and help you as needed to carry out things at this campus
25/08/2023, 12:47 pm - Aditeya Baral: Essentially the team wants RR to also experience the same things EC has experienced. You all can work with the current RR team to help bring this in
25/08/2023, 12:48 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Oh, I mean, all events are open to everyone :) homebrew offline events are conducted through HSP ECC, and there's no attendance restriction there, everyone is welcome so long as they register on time! I would strongly encourage more RR campus students to visit EC Campus for our workshops and fireside chats
25/08/2023, 12:48 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup, the goal here is to also get the RR community to be part of the HomeBrew OSS community you've built
25/08/2023, 12:49 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not denying that and as I've said it's amazing work really. But I think it's time RR was also exposed to these activities
25/08/2023, 12:50 pm - Aditeya Baral: Oh this died cause Heroku died and we didn't migrate it xD
25/08/2023, 12:50 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: fair point, but I'm not too sure how much bandwidth the current homebrew core / hsp ec core has to help out and make sure we can run events in parallel at both campuses. It would be extremely hands-on work, not sure if they have the time, and you know how hard third year is
25/08/2023, 12:50 pm - +91 87623 54645: You're always welcome to come attend our events, no restrictions there!
25/08/2023, 12:51 pm - Aditeya Baral: Understandable - that's why these enthu RR kids are there
25/08/2023, 12:51 pm - +91 96065 83508: The essence of open source is that it's open :)

You are free to participate in all activities we do. You are proposing organisational restructures which will only bring in extra bureaucratic overhead.

IMO let the structure be where it is since in all other aspects we're open anyway :)
25/08/2023, 12:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ah no, I'm not proposing any kind of organisational restructuring
25/08/2023, 12:52 pm - +91 6362 552 314: I think he means help mentor the HSP team at RR so that they can eventually host their own events like the EC campus.
25/08/2023, 12:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: HomeBrew is and will always be under you guys
25/08/2023, 12:52 pm - +91 88672 19961: That's a wonderful idea :) 
But we'll get back to you on that. 
Like Harini and Rowjee have mentioned, events are open and RR is free to participate ans be involved as much as they want. 
We intend on building a community, that's always how we've viewed HSP ECC, a community for us to nerd out :) <This message was edited>
25/08/2023, 12:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: So HomeBrew as a community has been really isolated to ECC - I don't think anyone at RR even knows about its presence
25/08/2023, 12:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: We want to expand your HomeBrew OSS community into RR
25/08/2023, 12:53 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: we don't really publicize
25/08/2023, 12:54 pm - Aditeya Baral: I think the folks at RR would greatly benefit from having a proper community for this though
25/08/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 88672 19961: Yup, we've always felt our work will speak for itself xD
Didn't really stat pad any of our work now that I think of it
25/08/2023, 12:55 pm - +91 87623 54645: It's an organic community, and we aren't looking at marketing explicitly about it. Although this forum has kids from both campuses, I'm sure they're now aware of it and are welcome to participate in Homebrew's initiatives
25/08/2023, 12:57 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: when we open up the homebrew discord, everyone is free to join. It is sort of a given that because homebrew started here, we have a much more active footprint on the EC campus than we do on the RR campus - and we know that organizing events there comes with its own set of headaches that EC campus might not necessarily have. 
Not exactly like we can C-c C-v the entire community effect to RR as and when we want to, right? And you'd know, given your experience building Hackerspace RR. It's going to be an extremely long-drawn process, and i'm not too sure if expansion at that scale is what we want right now.
25/08/2023, 12:59 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: if push comes to shove and the burden of getting things organized offline exceeds the benefit of doing so, homebrew might move away from the college entirely, existing as its own community but supported by HSP EC
25/08/2023, 1:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yup that's true. Expanding anything across campuses takes time and logistical effort. 

The main goal was that the OSS community at RR shouldn't die out. Unfortunately with PESOS not there anymore, there is nothing happening along those lines at RR. 

The cores wanted to introduce HomeBrew to RR as well and to sort of build it as a community backed by both EC as well as RR. Because one of the goals while expanding to ECC was to make the community larger and encourage collaboration across campuses
25/08/2023, 1:06 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Bruh we never had any problem with this aspect.

RR peeps have attended EC events and vice versa. Just yesterday, I attended a workshop conducted by Codechef EC and it was so good.
25/08/2023, 1:08 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But yeah should we create a separate community for FOSS or add the projects under HackerSpace??

Coz HackerSpace being a tech club, will be able to manage tech events and OSS together
25/08/2023, 1:08 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I'm talking about HackerSpace RR 
25/08/2023, 1:09 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Having more homebrew presence in RR campus does sound nice. I look forward to seeing juniors from RR take part in homebrew events and attend our workshops, but I'd much rather it be an organic growth there as it was here, so we're not really "pushing" homebrew - if there do happen to be a bunch of RR students as passionate about FOSS, I'd be glad to advice them on setting their own community, or if homebrew believes that they're the right people to continue the tradition, we can think about expansion, but until then I don't think we'd want to expand homebrew.
25/08/2023, 1:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Ah no hold on

The projects you see on HackerSpace GitHub were essentially part of the plans to build an OSS community. Now that there is already one backed by HackerSpace (HomeBrew), we want to simply contribute to it
25/08/2023, 1:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: Suraj it's not a contest about who owns what
25/08/2023, 1:10 pm - Aditeya Baral: At the end of the day the goal is to build a shared community
25/08/2023, 1:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: That's why I had started this
25/08/2023, 1:12 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: contributions to homebrew repos are welcome!
25/08/2023, 1:12 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yeah I thought it is a cool idea, but I gotta discuss abt this once with HackerSpace RR core
25/08/2023, 1:13 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Keeping this aside 
25/08/2023, 1:13 pm - +91 6366 682 139: EC guys I request you again 
25/08/2023, 1:13 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Add details to PESU for Dummies 
25/08/2023, 1:13 pm - +91 6366 682 139: And about EC clubs too
25/08/2023, 1:14 pm - +91 6366 682 139: There are several juniors asking me why is there zero info about EC campus 
25/08/2023, 1:15 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: I'll see who I can ask
25/08/2023, 1:15 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I told em "The campus is ambient, silent, very less crowded and has some really impressive infrastructure. That is all I know about it.

Any insider info about EC campus can only be provided by an EC student"
25/08/2023, 1:15 pm - Aditeya Baral: There are actually quite a few who are interested in OSS - since the community already existed at ECC, we thought sharing it across both campuses would benefit both parties
25/08/2023, 1:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: _insider info_
25/08/2023, 1:16 pm - Aditeya Baral: What kind of info are you looking for xD
25/08/2023, 1:16 pm - +91 6366 682 139: I saw a completely different side of the already good EC campus yesterday. I hadn't explored further than the main block last time.
25/08/2023, 1:17 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Anything like amenities, blocks, hostels, cafeterias and stuff
25/08/2023, 1:17 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Nothing sus dw lmao
25/08/2023, 1:18 pm - +91 6366 682 139: If there is actually any insider info, they'll know it once they start coming to the campus 
25/08/2023, 1:19 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yeah, rather than a merge we'd prefer more cohesive communication between the clubs in both campuses. More joint projects and such.
25/08/2023, 1:20 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah adding to this - we don't mean that the same events need to be organised across campuses
25/08/2023, 1:21 pm - Aditeya Baral: Each club will continue to function independently as they have
25/08/2023, 1:21 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Joint projects sound nice. We can discuss about this
25/08/2023, 1:21 pm - +91 6366 682 139: We could like hold seminars abt the same topics in the respective campuses coz tho many peeps are interested, they aren't able to come coz of the distance and time
25/08/2023, 1:22 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Like EC could plan out and hold a seminar, and later guide RR about it
25/08/2023, 1:22 pm - Aditeya Baral: We think the clubs right now are a little too isolated than what the original goal was. Better communication, shared communities and occassionally shared events and activities like contests
25/08/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But yeah this doesn't mean RR campus will stop coming to EC.

No matter what happens, I'll attend all workshops of EC even if it means I've to skip classes <This message was edited>
25/08/2023, 1:23 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Yesterday's seminar gave me a whole new view of C++ that I never experienced 
25/08/2023, 1:24 pm - Aditeya Baral: "this doesn't mean RR will stop coming to EC"

Why does this sound so aggressive üò≠
25/08/2023, 1:24 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Bruh why did you tell that ü•≤
25/08/2023, 1:25 pm - +91 6366 682 139: As I said before, we are divided by campuses but united by passion 
25/08/2023, 1:25 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Just that the lack of communication should be somehow resolved 
25/08/2023, 1:26 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: sounds like Kingfisher no xD "divided by campus, united by FOSS"
25/08/2023, 1:26 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: but yes
25/08/2023, 1:26 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: I agree
25/08/2023, 1:27 pm - +91 73389 36843: Yep, more people, better open source so it will definitely be fun for all of us

25/08/2023, 1:36 pm - +91 94488 26746: Hmm
25/08/2023, 1:36 pm - +91 6366 682 139: But yeah we have started to create open source projects under HackerSpace directly, so yeah 
25/08/2023, 1:36 pm - +91 94488 26746: But what did the club do?
25/08/2023, 1:36 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Current projects include PESU Discord bot, PESU for Dummies and Linkhub 
25/08/2023, 1:36 pm - Aditeya Baral: Die
25/08/2023, 1:36 pm - +91 6366 682 139: And many others which have less activity

25/08/2023, 1:37 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Demmm
25/08/2023, 1:37 pm - +91 94488 26746: In all seriousness, I know it was run by madhav, Dont know what happnd later
25/08/2023, 1:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: Basically what HomeBrew is today - it was an OSS community that contributed to projects together and organised events to promote OS
25/08/2023, 1:37 pm - +91 94488 26746: Hmm Nice
25/08/2023, 1:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: It was run by Atharva Raykar primarily
25/08/2023, 1:37 pm - Aditeya Baral: He was the one who rebooted it
25/08/2023, 1:38 pm - +91 94488 26746: Ahh okay
25/08/2023, 1:38 pm - +91 94488 26746: Hmm
25/08/2023, 1:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: Unfortunately it ran into the same issues as HackerSpace at RR
25/08/2023, 1:38 pm - +91 94488 26746: Is the Homebrew Discord server public btw?
25/08/2023, 1:38 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not yet

25/08/2023, 10:47 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Is it really you and me (victims of the smartphone epidemic) making these advances or people who have managed to pull themselves away for long enough to carry long-term, deep focus projects?
25/08/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 79052 60207: It's mostly people in companies who do these things for jobs
25/08/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 99168 84047: On contrary, each generation is more intelligent than the last. It's Flynn effect or so.

25/08/2023, 10:54 pm - +91 79052 60207: Punctuation are one of the reasons LLms are almost crazy, imagine making sand think what the difference a comma makes between a dad joke and this

25/08/2023, 11:03 pm - +91 82966 20053: But by the end of that week you‚Äôll realise you really don‚Äôt need it. You start getting ideas on literally anything and everything

25/08/2023, 11:05 pm - +91 82966 20053: If it‚Äôs limited only to the people you care, then they‚Äôd understand why you are going through this
25/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 82966 20053: What I mean to say is that if you feel like only the content from people who matter is causing the fomo, then we are really sorted
25/08/2023, 11:06 pm - +91 82966 20053: For heaven sake, try it _once_
If after that you feel, nah can‚Äôt do this for now then resume back.

28/08/2023, 5:47 pm - +91 73384 38241: fun story abt these systems. about 2ish months ago, during the isme conference at pes, one of the graduated seniors was presenting their capstone work as conference paper.
one of the guests, a BMSCE prof, was shocked by the amount of meshes (no. of smol divisons) they had achieved for this. he questioned the student presenting on how they got such a high number (15 million or smthg for a single model) and told that it would take days to do it.
student replied that he didnt remember the exact specs, but it took them approx 12hrs per model

a former pes prof happened to be the chair, and intervened by telling that pes has these beefy systems which allows them to do that much. he listed out the specs, and the bms prof was visually flabbergasted

31/08/2023, 9:23 pm - +91 6366 682 139: Capture the Flag, or CTF is a competition in which you gotta find vulnerabilities in the systems or websites which they provide you, and find password like stuff hidden in the depths, called flags. The more you capture, the more chances of winning.

In this event tho, it is answering tech related riddles that count as a capture. Questions could be easy or really tricky.

Ever wondered how PayTM can scan any QR Code in less than a second, from almost any angle? Or how Instagram filters can enhance your face, while still keeping it looking super realistic? 

üåü Introducing the *Computer Vision: A Primer on Convolutional Neural Networks and YOLOv5* course! 

ü™© I'm Shubhika, your dedicated subject matter expert, thrilled to impart the knowledge I've gained on my journey through the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.

ü§ñ Whether you're a first or second-year student with a curious mind for technology, this course is your gateway. Don't have any knowledge of programming languages, or no prior exposure to terms like "machine learning" or "neural networks"? No worries ‚Äì we'll start from scratch.

üîç *What sets this course apart?* While machine learning primarily deals with algorithms and predictions, Computer Vision empowers machines to *see* and *interpret* the world around them, akin to human vision.

That's right, the models that we'll build will show output right on your webcam! üíª

Throughout this course, we'll delve into creating models capable of:

üè• Diagnosing Medical Conditions
üåø Identifying Plant Species
üì∏ Enhancing Photography, and more!

03/09/2023, 2:44 pm - +91 96065 83508: define better
03/09/2023, 2:44 pm - +91 94488 26746: Better -> performance, UI, security
03/09/2023, 2:45 pm - +91 99670 58974: How old is your Mac?




If you have a 2015 mac, and can live without fancy features in favour of smoothness and speed, then Catalina better
03/09/2023, 2:46 pm - +91 96065 83508: If you‚Äôre on apple silicon, the updates are necessary.
03/09/2023, 2:46 pm - +91 98414 30530: not u pushing the catalina agenda again
03/09/2023, 2:46 pm - +91 94488 26746: let's say its a 2023 MAC
03/09/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 96065 83508: well necessary so that other software updates also go smoothly.
Apple likes to deprecate its api‚Äôs across versions. <This message was edited>

03/09/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 99670 58974: XDDDD
03/09/2023, 2:47 pm - +91 94488 26746: Coz I am trying to buy a mac
03/09/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 94488 26746: So trying to see Pros and Cons of buying
03/09/2023, 2:48 pm - +91 96065 83508: I assume you already have a mac?
03/09/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 94488 26746: No No, I have windows [shit laptop], but trying to buy a new laptop
03/09/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 96065 83508: do you game?
03/09/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 94488 26746: So wondering why not a MAC
03/09/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 94488 26746: No
03/09/2023, 2:49 pm - +91 99670 58974: If you‚Äôre buying Apple silicon then you‚Äôre gonna have issue with running some work related softwares
03/09/2023, 2:52 pm - Aditeya Baral: Get windows and dual boot
03/09/2023, 2:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: You won't face any issues running things needed at PES
03/09/2023, 2:53 pm - +91 94488 26746: üëç
03/09/2023, 2:53 pm - +91 94488 26746: yeh works
03/09/2023, 2:53 pm - Aditeya Baral: Plus will be cheaper also
03/09/2023, 2:54 pm - +91 94488 26746: yeh
03/09/2023, 2:54 pm - +91 73384 38241: the mac arc begins
03/09/2023, 2:55 pm - +91 96065 83508: I‚Äôd personally suggest you get an M1 Air for 80k (which is a solid deal for the amount of computer you get) or if you have the budget then the M2 Air for 1L.
The most noticeable feature would be the humongous full day+ battery life. The Airs also lack fans so they are super quite and super cool running as well. The performance is unparalleled to any windows laptop I‚Äôve used (especially in the 80k price range).

As for software shenanigans, I‚Äôm yet to face any. Incase anything does prop up you can always run a windows arm build in a vm (which is what I‚Äôve done a couple times no issues).
03/09/2023, 2:56 pm - +91 82177 03098: really kiran?
03/09/2023, 2:56 pm - +91 99670 58974: @919448826746 dont fall for the gaming laptop hype, unless you plan on using the GPU for AI/ML oriented workloads, spend the same amount on a laptop that is worth the same, your specs will be phenomenally better
03/09/2023, 2:57 pm - Aditeya Baral: Even if you do plan to run AIML workloads, Colab/Kaggle will be a much better option to train models on
03/09/2023, 2:57 pm - +91 73384 38241: gamer arc vs. mac arc
03/09/2023, 2:57 pm - +91 82177 03098: I did not consider this when getting my main laptop, weight. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR LAPTOP IS LIGHT. its a pain to carry is around
03/09/2023, 2:57 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Even then that GPU won't be enough for most ML workloads
03/09/2023, 2:57 pm - +91 82177 03098: and has battery life
03/09/2023, 2:57 pm - +91 94488 26746: yeh True üëç
03/09/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 82177 03098: I think these two is more imp for a college kid
03/09/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 99013 40162: macs good as long as the work isnt hardware intensive
03/09/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 73384 38241: builds up the back üôÉ
03/09/2023, 2:58 pm - +91 99013 40162: gaming, training etc
03/09/2023, 2:59 pm - Aditeya Baral: Yeah if you intend to get AIML work done also, get one with a basic Nvidia GPU so that you can still do minor testing on it. Non gaming laptops exist with these
03/09/2023, 2:59 pm - +91 94488 26746: Ah okay
03/09/2023, 2:59 pm - +91 96065 83508: That was from personal experience of course. Getting non-apple laptops for windows is absolute waste of money if you don‚Äôt game. Using linux would be a better option in that case. But I don‚Äôt have enough experience with linux based machines so I can‚Äôt really tell.
03/09/2023, 2:59 pm - +91 96065 83508: 1day+ battery life is unheard of in windows world, I‚Äôll tell you that
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 96065 83508: in the 80k price range
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 99013 40162: yea industry also prefers linux over mac os
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 94488 26746: worth it ig
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 82177 03098: not really, industry prefferse servers on linux
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 82177 03098: not developers
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 82177 03098: hek, they expect developers on windows
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - +91 82177 03098: maybe thats my experience lol
03/09/2023, 3:00 pm - Aditeya Baral: Not all
03/09/2023, 3:01 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Yes
03/09/2023, 3:01 pm - +91 82177 03098: yeah yea, I was kidding
03/09/2023, 3:01 pm - Aditeya Baral: A lot of them use Macs lol
03/09/2023, 3:01 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Nobody sensible uses windows for development in the industry
03/09/2023, 3:01 pm - +91 99013 40162: as far as i heard, all developers from netapp were recommended to use linux
03/09/2023, 3:01 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: It's either mac or Linux
03/09/2023, 3:02 pm - Aditeya Baral: If it's Linux you'll be given access to a Linux server. If it's Mac, you'll be usually given a Macbook
03/09/2023, 3:02 pm - +91 94488 26746: So, both in Industry/ Academia, Windows has no respect? üòÇ

But there are some annoyances as well (nothing without work-arounds ofc)
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - Aditeya Baral: And I've seen the hell it takes to setup simple things
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - +91 99670 58974: Even better, I didn‚Äôt know of this

Gaming laptops are absolutely pointless, bad battery, bottlenecked GPU and terrible thermals
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: And even then the MacOS Kernel is a BSD kernel, with some unix compatibility, so there you go
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - Anirudh Rowjee: Nope.
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - +91 94488 26746: Average Windows lover :)
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - +91 99670 58974: I think of buying laptops like:
I buy hardware, put OS separately xD
03/09/2023, 3:03 pm - +91 94488 26746: Real Computer Engineer moment
03/09/2023, 3:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: Gaming laptops are primarily only for gaming. Beyond that, you probably don't need it
03/09/2023, 3:04 pm - +91 73384 38241: that iit guy?
03/09/2023, 3:04 pm - Aditeya Baral: No xD
03/09/2023, 3:05 pm - +91 94488 26746: Oh
03/09/2023, 3:08 pm - +91 96065 83508: Ye but linux has its own quirks as well. Like there aren‚Äôt a lot of laptops with retina displays, fractional scaling doesn‚Äôt work. Linux is like the tinkerer‚Äôs choice, macs a non-tinkerer‚Äôs.

04/09/2023, 6:20 pm - +91 76194 22994: ah so its tough for people who dont know any languages?
04/09/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 79052 60207: Enough time to learn, depends on what u want to make also
04/09/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 97419 66168: You'll have learnt something by the end of it I'm sure
04/09/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Not really learning python takes few hours that is more than enough

04/09/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 76194 22994: so its friendly for coding infants?
04/09/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 6361 270 426: U can learn stuff during the hack can spend 5-6 hrs on that

04/09/2023, 6:23 pm - +91 76194 22994: nono i am honestly tryin to get my friends involved they are just doubtful abt how theyll do
04/09/2023, 6:24 pm - +91 94488 26746: I remember going to a Hallathon back in my 1st semester. it was super hard and we backed out at the end, but we learnt a bunch of things like Deep Fake detection among other things. Everyone must start somewhere
04/09/2023, 6:24 pm - +91 6361 270 426: First few hackathons even if u wouldn't be able to build the final prototype u'll get to learn a lot that's reason enough

04/09/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 76194 22994: ok thank u for all these
04/09/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 76194 22994: time to ss and send them these
04/09/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 79052 60207: Bring in a hackathon will always be better than not being in one, you will learn a lot, network with a lot of mentors, get a good idea of what to do after tha hackathon and at end also will have a good time, don't forget,it's essentially a sleepover with free food
04/09/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 76194 22994: LMFAOOOO

05/09/2023, 6:58 am - +91 84317 27690: then i think you might as well go w the msi
05/09/2023, 6:58 am - +91 76194 22994: hmm

06/09/2023, 1:01 am - Anirudh Rowjee: I don't think you can do it in a form
06/09/2023, 1:02 am - +91 94488 26746: can we do the same in a typeform?
06/09/2023, 1:03 am - +91 94488 26746: we wanted to ask the users their Discord ID, but some ppl put Discord ID as "I will do" in that space

06/09/2023, 1:18 am - +91 94488 26746: yeh true, but this just to get a headcount
06/09/2023, 1:18 am - Anirudh Rowjee: You can send the server link out later
06/09/2023, 1:18 am - Aditeya Baral: Email will give you headcount

07/09/2023, 12:01 am - +91 82478 57046: there is a rather striking difference between being the extension of another club, and being an independent club

07/09/2023, 12:01 am - +91 82478 57046: and having one being subordinate to the other usually ends up with eveyone being unhappy

07/09/2023, 12:24 am - +91 94488 26746: Mainly Quantum Computing, But we are slowly opening for all Quantum Solutions .. So, thereby spreading reach into quantum-technology rather than quantum-computing itself. Quantum computing is a very focussed area . As a club we are trying to harbinger the field overall, and amass people with varied interests, looking for a solution in quantum.

09/09/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 94488 26746: Like if he/she is aiming for Core -> without masters, no Job xD -> So 9+ 
And if Job [indeed it will be CS job] -> 8.5+ is decent
09/09/2023, 9:04 pm - +91 94488 26746: P.S: its possible to get job, without masters in Core, but its very hard
09/09/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 94488 26746: Basically u shud be like @919148872753
09/09/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 76194 22994: hmmm how hard would u say its for an ece student to get cs job
09/09/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 76194 22994: ah thats a big feat
09/09/2023, 9:05 pm - +91 94488 26746: Depends on how much practice one does, keep LeetCoding, CodeForces, etc , learn DSA, DAA, DBMS, OS [basically do Minors]
09/09/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 94488 26746: Then 60% of CSE is done with Minors
09/09/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 94488 26746: remaining 40 is all useless subjects which u can learn on ur own
09/09/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 76194 22994: ok in ur opinion, what are the THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS OR SUBJECTS do u think id need
09/09/2023, 9:06 pm - +91 76194 22994: for cs job
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: and the Minors Coordinator has confirmed tat, list of students who finish all Minor courses, will be sent over All companies, so that it aids us in placements
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 73384 38241: prolly. but much harder than cse for sure
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: Oh
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: ok
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 76194 22994: all minors?hmm damn
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: CSE ppl enjoy so much in class üòé
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: yep
09/09/2023, 9:07 pm - +91 94488 26746: if u want minor Degree, do all 4
09/09/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 76194 22994: what all 4?
09/09/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 76194 22994: what are they?
09/09/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 81056 35154: Mate I would say focus on what you wanna do and think about learning then important skills for job
09/09/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 94488 26746: Tbh, depends on interest, but doing minors and LeetCoding, CodeForcing enough for CSE roles in Companies
09/09/2023, 9:08 pm - +91 94488 26746: DSA
DBMS
DAA
OS

09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: The goal isn't to solve X number of problems, it's to get better at problem solving
09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 76194 22994: says a lot abt a man
09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 76194 22994: hmm  true
09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: So regardless of progress
09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: Keep learning and improving
09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - Aditeya Baral: That's all that matters
09/09/2023, 9:11 pm - +91 76194 22994: but all ik rn is python, i havent touched java in over 5 yrs i cant do a lot in it
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 76194 22994: hmm do i focus on leetcode and prob solvin
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: Its fine, you'll learn or pick it up again over time
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 76194 22994: or learnin a language
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: You don't randomly learn languages
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - Aditeya Baral: You learn a language for a particular task/field
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 91488 72753: 1. LinkedIn for networking
2. Gain skills from learning a programming language or whatever depending on your goal. Then develop a project.
3. Use the project (showcase it) in a meet-up of some kind. There are tons of meetups in Bangalore. Networking a lot and potentially getting hired by a start-up. 
These are the ways i have operated and I have job offers from companies this way
09/09/2023, 9:12 pm - +91 81056 35154: Be like your team member learn sql queries  üòÇüòÇ
09/09/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 81974 45749: Real lmfao
09/09/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 81974 45749: I got my thing from networking kinda sorta too
09/09/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 76194 22994: hmm so ur sayin, for now solvin probs with just python > a new language?
09/09/2023, 9:13 pm - +91 91488 72753: Langauge is just a tool to program. A few languages can communicate a lot with few words i.e python. A few languages need more verbosity to communicate even a small command i.e C or Java
09/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 91488 72753: You can use any. Just don't waste time trying to learn all the programming languages in the world. A good rule of thumb would be to know one scripting language (python preferably) and one low-level lang like C
09/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 76194 22994: ok so python check
09/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 76194 22994: low level HMMMM
09/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 81974 45749: True
09/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 91488 72753: Not for competitive programming, just stick to python. If you really want the fastest code, just learn C++
09/09/2023, 9:15 pm - +91 81974 45749: My scripting lang became bash of all thinga lmfao
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 91488 72753: noice, man of culture
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 81974 45749: After all I do use it for mundane shit
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 76194 22994: do i start on c or c++ now?
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 76194 22994: or later?
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 91488 72753: Which semester?
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 91488 72753: You'll learn C in college
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 81974 45749: Like today i had to find emails in a text file, just used grep simpol
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 76194 22994: 1st
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 81974 45749: He is frosher
09/09/2023, 9:16 pm - +91 76194 22994: :
09/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 76194 22994: yes:'')
09/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 91488 72753: I'd say stick to python for now and get a good understanding of problem solving
09/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 91488 72753: And data structures
09/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 76194 22994: aight bless then
09/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 91488 72753: You can carry that over to any language after that
09/09/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 76194 22994: id say without biggin myself up too much i am like a good 7/10 proficient in python <This message was edited>
09/09/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 81974 45749: I don't even remember C or Python
09/09/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 91488 72753: Python is vast, i learn something new everyday in python and I've been using python since 8th grade
09/09/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 76194 22994: AYO
09/09/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 76194 22994: THIS IS HEAVY TRUE
09/09/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 81974 45749: C is useless kinda unless you're well versed with syscall usage and stuff
09/09/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 91488 72753: Just write assembly, yes
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 81974 45749: Yes lmfao
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 81974 45749: If you go low enough
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 81974 45749: Suddenly you'll go from C to assembly
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 91488 72753: Just supply barrier voltage to flip bits, yes
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 76194 22994: wtf?
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 81974 45749: M-x butterfly
09/09/2023, 9:19 pm - +91 91488 72753: Or not barrier voltage if you are @916362576633
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 91488 72753: Lower than barrier
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 81974 45749: Does he do M-x butterfly
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 81974 45749: Blow air carefully to move the electrons to gates ah
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 99453 25527: Reminds me of the Dunning-Kruger Effect
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 91488 72753: He's one of the smortest dudes in CHIPS
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 91488 72753: So yes
09/09/2023, 9:20 pm - +91 81974 45749: Damn

09/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 91488 72753: I M-x butterfly-ed in class
09/09/2023, 9:21 pm - +91 76194 22994: but i was also the same child who has imposter syndrome and underestimate myself also
09/09/2023, 9:22 pm - +91 81974 45749: Amogus
09/09/2023, 9:22 pm - +91 91488 72753: That's most people in college. Atleast in this group idk about college, there might overestimate-rs

09/09/2023, 9:24 pm - +91 91488 72753: I like programming you can ask @918197445749 but I'll never jump ship to SDE roles
09/09/2023, 9:24 pm - +91 81974 45749: Real lmfao

09/09/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 91488 72753: Because you can develop software in semiconductor industry. Which is what I'm doing
09/09/2023, 9:25 pm - +91 81974 45749: But I indulge in both

09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 91488 72753: Understandable
09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 91488 72753: It's all fluff
09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 91488 72753: Most of it
09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 81974 45749: Which day
09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 91488 72753: Don't fall for it

09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 91488 72753: It's all done by institutions to drive up admissions and tuition fees
09/09/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 76194 22994: its like, there are multiple sides, there are people memein abt the 'ece bein best of both worls ever green'

09/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 76194 22994: that i agree, but people say its in general
09/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 78388 85068: I thought u said he worked at morgan stanley
09/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 81974 45749: Yeah like lel I love every part of systems engineering
09/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 76194 22994: its tough even if ur well built and all
09/09/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 91488 72753: i disagree
09/09/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 91488 72753: Most people that day are probably some uncles who don't know anything about the industry and how it operates
09/09/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 76194 22994: uff
09/09/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 76194 22994: now that actually gave me a lot of confidence
09/09/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 91488 72753: Yes, it's difficult to get a good job in ece but it's the same in cs. It's just that you have mass recruiters as your saving grace who come under CSE placements
09/09/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 6362 576 633: Today all the greatest 3 cames in just to tell us this loudly

09/09/2023, 10:09 pm - +91 99670 58974: While M1 is a marvel in consumer terms, it‚Äôs a nightmare in repair-ability terms
09/09/2023, 10:09 pm - +91 96630 06833: and a nightmare if you want to install anything other than macOS on it
09/09/2023, 10:09 pm - +91 76194 22994: pcmr>affle

10/09/2023, 11:13 am - +91 76194 22994: serious L for ryz f 7535hs against 12700h
10/09/2023, 11:13 am - +91 76194 22994: wtf?
10/09/2023, 11:14 am - +91 76194 22994: hmm 50 p multi core and single core performance over 4050?
10/09/2023, 11:25 am - +91 96117 91135: Well the Ryzen 5 7535HS is a Rembrandt chip so it's based off Zen 3+ only not the latest Zen 4 architecture so it's performance is similar to 5000-6000 series chips
Also, the i7 12700H is a different tier level for chips cuz you're comparing a Ryzen 5 to an i7
10/09/2023, 11:26 am - +91 76194 22994: yeye true, but rn my dilemma is 4050 or the core performace :'')
10/09/2023, 11:26 am - +91 76194 22994: the 4050 sounds nice
10/09/2023, 11:26 am - +91 76194 22994: i cant even find 3060/3070 for that price:'')
10/09/2023, 11:27 am - +91 99670 58974: Why gaming one
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 82177 03098: SKIP OUT ON GRAPHICS CARD
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 76194 22994: hmm because gamin
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 82177 03098: It drains battery and increases weight and heats your laptop
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 76194 22994: nooooooooo dont do that to meplss
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 82177 03098: Bruder, get laptop for college not for gaming
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 76194 22994: true
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 76194 22994: but i wanna game too :'')
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 96117 91135: If you want to game, you can compromise on the CPU and go for the 4050
Else, always get the better CPU option
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 99670 58974: You‚Äôre paying a lot more for a temp limited and spec locked hardware
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 81974 45749: Real
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 76194 22994: i need the gpu tho
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 76194 22994: not just for gamin
10/09/2023, 11:28 am - +91 99670 58974: You can buy a gaming rig and a thin-and-light in the same cost
10/09/2023, 11:29 am - +91 76194 22994: i need it for blender
10/09/2023, 11:29 am - +91 81974 45749: Yes

10/09/2023, 11:29 am - +91 99670 58974: Then why you want to waste on a gaming laptop, you‚Äôre not gonna be able to render while sitting in bus or class xD
10/09/2023, 11:29 am - +91 76194 22994: true
10/09/2023, 11:29 am - +91 76194 22994: but my rig dont have 30 series

10/09/2023, 11:30 am - +91 99670 58974: Get a high end thin-and-light
10/09/2023, 11:30 am - +91 99670 58974: Buy a new GPU, sell the old one
10/09/2023, 11:30 am - +91 76194 22994: hmmmmm

10/09/2023, 11:32 am - +91 94488 26746: why do you need GPU for? Training ML / DL Models and AR-VR work?
10/09/2023, 11:32 am - +91 76194 22994: i dont have 2060
10/09/2023, 11:32 am - +91 76194 22994: 2060 desktop costs

10/09/2023, 11:39 am - +91 76194 22994: multi core all cores can turbo and stay over 3.85
10/09/2023, 11:39 am - +91 76194 22994: and i have overvolted the gpu and a bit of extra memory clock
10/09/2023, 11:39 am - +91 76194 22994: and yet

10/09/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: Idk about ARVR but there is no way anyone today trains ML models locally. Small NNs, sure but everything is still much faster on Colab/Kaggle
10/09/2023, 11:46 am - +91 76194 22994: DAYUMN
10/09/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: Don't buy a gaming laptop unless you want to game
10/09/2023, 11:46 am - Aditeya Baral: That's the only suggestion I have
10/09/2023, 11:47 am - +91 99670 58974: In a moving bus/metro/train
10/09/2023, 11:47 am - +91 84317 27690: i carry my laptop and my charger to college everyday :) i don't use the lifts :)

10/09/2023, 11:47 am - Aditeya Baral: I mean not everyone can afford to have a gaming setup at home + a laptop for work
10/09/2023, 11:47 am - +91 76194 22994: because moms gonna start using my desktop soon
10/09/2023, 11:47 am - +91 76194 22994: THISS
10/09/2023, 11:47 am - +91 6362 176 909: Do gaming laptop specs have any effect on any type of programming that we do ?
10/09/2023, 11:47 am - +91 76194 22994: nah
10/09/2023, 11:48 am - +91 76194 22994: just decent proc

10/09/2023, 11:48 am - +91 78388 85068: u cant even game on a gaming laptop without plugging in ü§£
10/09/2023, 11:48 am - +91 99670 58974: You can spend 1/5th of the cost of a gaming laptop on a basic thin-and-light and use the rest on a gaming desktop
10/09/2023, 11:48 am - +91 76194 22994: LMFAO
10/09/2023, 11:48 am - +91 76194 22994: my budget is 90 k strict anna
10/09/2023, 11:48 am - +91 84317 27690: u can open stuff fasterü§©

10/09/2023, 11:49 am - +91 99670 58974: This is just what I‚Äôve seen and done, so ik that it worked
10/09/2023, 11:49 am - +91 76194 22994: see u still need like 30k for a laptop
10/09/2023, 11:49 am - +91 84317 27690: i wish i was joking but if i opened vs on my old laptop everything else slowed down so drastically
10/09/2023, 11:49 am - +91 76194 22994: and rest 60 k
10/09/2023, 11:49 am - +91 76194 22994: u aint gettin nothing
10/09/2023, 11:49 am - +91 76194 22994: not a desktop
10/09/2023, 11:50 am - +91 84317 27690: now I don't worry about that, i can have whatever i want open
10/09/2023, 11:50 am - +91 76194 22994: because ill need monitor
10/09/2023, 11:50 am - +91 76194 22994: keeb mouse

10/09/2023, 11:51 am - +91 99670 58974: See what works for you bro, cause getting a gaming laptop, hasn‚Äôt ever had the payoff that it honestly should have, based on user-experiences and spec comparisons
10/09/2023, 11:51 am - +91 76194 22994: 50 k u aint gettin :'')

10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 76194 22994: and i considered the cheap laptop to be 30k
10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 78388 85068: ehh?
10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 81974 45749: Not possible in 90 imo ig

10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 81974 45749: Ye
10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 81974 45749: Desktop itself would be 70 brev like decent build
10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 76194 22994: and i couldve sold my current desktop gpu added more money got better gpu
10/09/2023, 11:53 am - +91 76194 22994: for desktop
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - +91 76194 22994: 85+
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - +91 81974 45749: 40 ez for a laptop you won't have a stroke using
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - +91 81974 45749: Ez
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - +91 76194 22994: ha i have a decent rig
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - +91 76194 22994: which is closer to 90k
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - +91 81974 45749: But?
10/09/2023, 11:54 am - Aditeya Baral: Unless the gaming is really important, you can compromise on the GPU on your laptop
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - Aditeya Baral: That is if you wont have your desktop anymore
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - +91 81974 45749: I mean i've seen friends using some laptops to play forza 4 and it ran for 2 hrs ez in class
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - +91 76194 22994: uh the gamin is my stress relief hobby
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - Aditeya Baral: But again my suggestion would be not to get a gaming laptop unless absolutely needed
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - +91 76194 22994: and
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - +91 76194 22994: gpu is also for unity/blender too
10/09/2023, 11:55 am - Aditeya Baral: If you wont have access to your desktop for those things, then think about getting a gaming laptop I guess
10/09/2023, 11:56 am - +91 76194 22994: i wont have access to it much
10/09/2023, 11:56 am - +91 76194 22994: or else i wouldve just gotten a decent
10/09/2023, 11:56 am - +91 76194 22994: laptop
10/09/2023, 11:56 am - +91 76194 22994: for like 50-60
10/09/2023, 11:57 am - Aditeya Baral: IMO you wont be gaming or rendering things at college or while travelling
10/09/2023, 11:57 am - +91 76194 22994: and i wouldve saved like 30-40k
10/09/2023, 11:57 am - +91 76194 22994: YE YE
10/09/2023, 11:57 am - +91 76194 22994: defo

10/09/2023, 11:59 am - Aditeya Baral: Think about it, I think people here have given their suggestions
10/09/2023, 11:59 am - +91 76194 22994: ye sigh :'')

10/09/2023, 1:47 pm - +91 94488 26746: But note that IP address will not reveal the exact location, it only reveals the approximate / General location of the user
10/09/2023, 1:47 pm - +91 94488 26746: For example like City / Area ZIP Code
10/09/2023, 1:47 pm - +91 76194 22994: and that too it usually reveals the isp's server location
10/09/2023, 1:47 pm - +91 94488 26746: yes <This message was edited>

12/09/2023, 8:54 pm - +91 99024 20654: Unironically termux + nvim for me. There is no mouse on android (for the most part) and nvim saves the day.

You can run gcc, clang, python and literally most everything you run on linux usually using termux.

Make sure to get termux from fdroid and not play store cause ~google bad~
12/09/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 76194 22994: +1
12/09/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 99024 20654: If this is your purpose then python is fantastic. Learning ruby is not necessary. But why not lol if you can spare the time, ruby is a fun lang :D
12/09/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 76194 22994: is it a fun lang? hmmm
12/09/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 76194 22994: ik python is a lot already
12/09/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 99024 20654: If not nvim then nano or _anything_
12/09/2023, 8:55 pm - +91 76194 22994: but its like when i have a script thats writtin in ruby
12/09/2023, 8:56 pm - +91 99024 20654: Understandable
12/09/2023, 8:56 pm - +91 76194 22994: it has weird ass syntax mix of python and java
12/09/2023, 8:56 pm - +91 76194 22994: idk how to modify it
12/09/2023, 8:56 pm - +91 76194 22994: its like flow control syntax is similar to python
12/09/2023, 8:57 pm - +91 76194 22994: there is no indentation shit
12/09/2023, 8:57 pm - +91 99024 20654: Yeah
12/09/2023, 8:57 pm - +91 99024 20654: ```end```

12/09/2023, 10:13 pm - +91 94488 26746: It's common knowledge that college courses don't teach you anything. I think that that notion is harming people more than helping them.

College courses teach you fundamentals of computer science that ultimately make you a good engineer. What they don't do is teach you practical things. So in an ideal world you need to take your courses seriously and continue building skills outside.

Learning web frameworks, grinding leetcode, collecting certifications like you're Thanos collecting infinity stones feels good but doesn't do much to teach you the fundamentals that are essential to be a good engineer.

My two cents would be to use your college curriculum as an index for things that you need to study and then study them through equivalent college courses that are available freely from university like cmu, harvard, mit, Stanford and such. The quality of teaching is far better than what most Indian colleges teach.

As a fresher,, start with CS50 which is from Harvard. That course helped me a lot when I started college and right now it has multiple tracks. I'd recommend trying out all the tracks to get a vast breadth of knowledge and then you can dig deeper into what you like.

And if you are a professional struggling to grow your CTC then stop running behind the cool latest stack and go back to basics.

I never enjoyed grinding leetcode or cp because it didn't feel productive to me. Yes I struggled during placements because of it. I struggled to write code in the set time limit not with coming up with the solution but all it took was a couple of companies and a week of looking into the tricks people use to write smaller code and I was able to clear the OA. Interviews with good companies was not an issue because interviews are more like conversations where you get to show off your knowledge (remember knowledge comes from studying and not grinding).

MIT OCW has awesome courses that teach you basic and advanced DSA. I highly recommend that and also this website to brush up on your competitive programming https://algo.is/

PS. If you disagree then more power to you. I will not be engaging in arguments in comments.

Edit. I didn't expect this to blow up. Something that I feel I should mention is that you should never take any advice on the internet as a Bible (including this one). Everyone has different struggles and different situations understand the context and apply what makes sense to you. There isn't one guaranteed path to success. There are many and you have to find yours.

13/09/2023, 5:54 pm - +91 76194 22994: because nvidia drivers wouldn't work
13/09/2023, 5:54 pm - +91 76194 22994: for 1650

but to get them to work everything else breaks üôÇüëç

13/09/2023, 6:13 pm - +91 89518 77127: coz having a fallback iGPU seems like a good idea to have unless you have very specific reasons to avoid entirely
13/09/2023, 6:19 pm - +91 76194 22994: ok major point was the pricing honestly
13/09/2023, 6:19 pm - +91 76194 22994: it was a major drifference
13/09/2023, 6:19 pm - +91 76194 22994: iirc it was like 6k difference
13/09/2023, 6:19 pm - +91 76194 22994: which is true
13/09/2023, 6:19 pm - +91 76194 22994: but the price was a huge factor
13/09/2023, 6:19 pm - +91 89518 77127: total cost of your processor? how much did you spend on that?

13/09/2023, 6:20 pm - +91 76194 22994: it was like

13/09/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 76194 22994: that sorta just giv it 51 49 to f series
13/09/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 89518 77127: ok yeah then that's a massive difference lel
13/09/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 76194 22994: the heat output conparitively
13/09/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 76194 22994: and during that time i was doing a lot of cache intensive workloads
13/09/2023, 6:23 pm - +91 76194 22994: like a whole subnet scan
13/09/2023, 6:23 pm - +91 76194 22994: the script was multithreaded
13/09/2023, 6:23 pm - +91 76194 22994: so it would fill up the cache very quickly
13/09/2023, 6:24 pm - +91 76194 22994: and i5 gen 9 didnt have a lot of cache
13/09/2023, 6:24 pm - +91 76194 22994: and this was when 10th gen did not exist
13/09/2023, 6:24 pm - +91 76194 22994: and amd had just started pickin up pace
13/09/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 76194 22994: a single 64 bit hash bruteforcing
13/09/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 76194 22994: would take
13/09/2023, 6:25 pm - +91 76194 22994: quite a long time
13/09/2023, 6:26 pm - +91 76194 22994: i had a regular i5 9400 chip desktop before that

13/09/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 76194 22994: but dosent the noise die after a small range? will it be efficient to even do so?
13/09/2023, 6:58 pm - +91 94488 26746: What's the difference between SDE1 & SDE2, and _Between Base, CTC in company salary_?

13/09/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Yes that certain range can be amplified by low voltage amps
13/09/2023, 7:00 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Sub threshold cmos is also a thing
13/09/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 76194 22994: ok but noise is soo random, wouldnt it be ineff to modulate all that to dc?
13/09/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Yea so the main issue is b/w all the stages there is massive power loss
13/09/2023, 7:01 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Say from the amp to the rectifier
13/09/2023, 7:02 pm - +91 76194 22994: whats the loss?heat?but thats too low in terms of current for any heat
13/09/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 76194 22994: i^2rt
13/09/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 76194 22994: where loss?what form?
13/09/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Nope impedance matching leads to higher capcitors and inductors and that energy is lost as heat
13/09/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 76194 22994: ohhh icccc
13/09/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 6361 270 426: Like essentially heat itself
13/09/2023, 7:03 pm - +91 76194 22994: hmmm
13/09/2023, 7:04 pm - +91 76194 22994: is there more on that?

13/09/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 6361 270 426: It's just thr concept that was amazing low power iot devices wouldn't need a supply
13/09/2023, 7:05 pm - +91 76194 22994: true as a concept its actually nice
13/09/2023, 7:06 pm - +91 76194 22994: if its pulled off idk how i am not a genius
